NEG first , i do n't own an iphone , but ... <br> <br> i always download a cracked copy of any software i might use prior to buying it . too many times i 've found badly written programs that were bug ridden , failed to live up to their hype , or simply outright junk . when i do find an app i like , i pay for it - that way i can take up any problems with the developer , feel confident talking on a ng -LRB- yeah , i love the people who complain their software is n't working properly only to discover the crack has n't activated some part of it ! -RRB- <br> <br> so sure , try the cracked version - but if you like it , pay for it !

NEG leona helmsley went to jail for tax evasion . others get cabinet positions . hah !!
NEG it only stimulates the economy if you make tax cuts and increase spending at the same time , which is what you 're talking about . <br> <br> the only problem is that it stimulates the economy at the expense of the future . you ca n't cut taxes and increase spending indefinitely . despite what cheney claimed about increased gdp making up for the shortfall ... that 's a ponzi scheme and he 's a moron . <br>

NEG hi mowe , <br> <br> i do have a few questions . i understand that in islam , you must believe in all that is taught by the prophet and can not disagree lest you are no longer a muslim . is that correct ? <br> <br> 1 - if so , how do you feel about the duty of the husband to discipline his wife via physical beatings ? <br> <br> 2 - how do you feel about the doctrine that explains it is ok for a man to have several wives and for the marriage of little girls of 9 and 10 years to middle aged men ? -LRB- a few weeks back a judge refused to annul a marriage in saudi arabia when the mother pleaded for her 10 year old girl who was married off to the fathers ' 47 year old friend as repayment for a debt -RRB- <br> <br> 3 - how do you feel about the fact that your testimony is worth half that of a man 's ? <br> <br> 4 - how do you feel about muhammad 's doctrine that allows for temporary marriages in order to allow his soldiers to have sex with women and then leave them with no rights after the temporary marriage is over -LRB- mind you this still goes on in certain muslim countries -RRB- . <br> <br> these are just a few examples of what i view as unreasonable demands of islam . <br> <br> i ca n't answer your question as to why people convert to islam - people convert to scientology as well even though so many consider it a dangerous cult . <br> <br> i have however heard too many stories of those who left islam , especially women and their stories of abuse and subjugation are horrific . <br> <br>
NEG considering the dhs has send undercover agents into the likes of code pink , this really does n't need to have a reasonable explanation . this is par for the course .
NEG that 's why he keeps rewarding them with super bowl wins .
NEG i have this feeling that i just saw a glimpse of the future right then .
NEG this story is n't about marijuana . even if its legalized swat teams will continue to execute no-knock warrants when going after cocaine , ecstasy , heroin , meth , pcp , etc. and continue to abuse their power and authority the way they did here . if that box had contained a kilo of cocaine and the owner of the house was n't the mayor of the town but just some random citizen unlucky enough to have their address picked by the drug dealers as a drop then you 'd probably never hear this story . the cops would just lie like they apparently did both in getting the warrant -LRB- it was n't a no-knock warrant -RRB- and trying to cover up after the fact -LRB- claiming the man opened the door then slammed it in the cops face , that the dogs were threatening the cops , etc -RRB- . <br> <br> legalizing marijuana wo n't stop this abuse by the police . it 'll just remove one of the many reasons they have to abuse their power .
NEG because they understood the basics of us politics : <br> - wave bible in front of crowd ! <br> - promise them tax cuts and more guns <br> - tell them that usa is 1 ! <br> <br> repeat and rinse until a seat in congress has been secured ! <br>
NEG so if you 're a government official , someone can use you , your face , and likeness for anything they want , without you having any kind of input whatsoever ?

NEG i just choose ` inaccurate ' when i bury it .
POS knowing how to bet/when to bet can make people think you have a good hand even if you do n't . so you do n't need a good hand to win a hand . <br> <br> sometimes even if you bet right you can still lose . similar to football or something wide reviever with more skill can generally escape the defense but will never catch 100 % of passes thrown to them .
NEG does the religious right have the right when the liberal left tries to pawn their ` evolution ' bullshit onto them to tell them that they are wrong , will not tolerate their bullshit and that they can fuck off ?

NEG i 'm all for this plan . i love love love his analogies . but these ideas will only come to pass when the vampires -LRB- board of directors and corrupt/silly politicians -RRB- have sucked the last dollar out of the economy . it 's funny though that when they 're the only ones left with money it will no longer have any value .

POS god , how i would love to untie that bowtie of hers .
NEG if i send them a brick or some dog turd , i wonder how much it 'd be valued at
NEG i know other people have said it , but i really do n't think this your typical scam ... if you send your property away without knowing what it is worth and you blindly accept what someone says it is worth then you are a fool and more power to cash4gold . <br> <br> is this really that different than a best buy extended service plan ? or upgrading your ram through dell when you buy a new computer ? or getting that ` rustproofing ' for your new car ? <br> <br> full-tilt capitalism maybe , but scam ? ehhhhh
NEG as title suggests , it is several ` missing links ' of a very big , very disturbing puzzle . . the links usually not discussed as ` acceptable ' truths , links conveniently left out of other documentaries . . cia ? do n't think so . the rabbit hole goes much deeper than 1 single film could ever be capable of . missing links highlights several culprits behind the curtain hidden safely in shadows of this fraud of the century . <br> <br> pnac is the cornerstone to 9/11 . just ask sibel edmonds ashcroft invoked the ` state secrets ' privilege on her to silence her completely and prevent her from revealing the truth of their crime networks and weapons/arms trading profiteer deals . they are afraid of her speaking in a court of law , under oath , of what she knows of this cover-up . what have they got to hide ? why such intense secrecy . is this how an innocent party acts ? 9/11 is a trans-national scandal that would embarrass far too many ` important ' people . <br> <br> any wonder why this pnac ` think tank ' group and their ` new pearl harbor ' to put our major-theater war manifesto in motion - ` coincidence ' was never investigated , questioned , held to account , probed , much less mentioned or analyzed in the slightest by the usual paid-for talking pundits on controlled fake ` news ' networks to speak of . .
NEG you should read and study the bible in its entirety before you say anything like that . at least do your research or something . man , what a waste of diggs from other people ... <br> <br> ignorance is bliss but it 's not useful .
NEG yeah , all 7 seasons of macgyver were really mastercard commercials too !

NEG so if you sold your house for $ 1 , and then decided 10 years later you wanted it back , someone should just hand it over to you ?
NEG since when did football become a non-aggressive sport , and cardinals fans just face the fact that your defense just could n't pull it out because if they did you all would n't be crying about it . arizona had plenty of chances to win this game including the interception that went back for a touchdown before half , if they get 7 there the cardinals probably win this game . besides what affect did harrison have on the outcome of this game after the interception return ... nothing . so throw him out and you still lost . nobody can just enjoy the game i guess ... typical of internet forums and digg .
NEG oh please . every other os in the world handles this better than vista . this is microsoft catering to the shit for brains users out there who click on every flashing banner on the net and then blame microsoft for providing an insecure system . why should i be inconvenienced because of them ? there are plenty of people who know how to use their system properly and even run their machine without anti-virus/spyware software without any problems . you know why ? because they 're not fucking retarded . <br> <br> i bet your one of those people who drink a bottle of draino unless the warning label said not to . i do n't want my os holding my hand for me .
NEG i would have to say i 'm torn on the issue . on one hand , i like the idea of having work to do here in the us . i like money , i like having a job . and when people buy from my company -LRB- an american one -RRB- , i get to keep my job . i know there 's all sorts of talk from people about how ` oh protectionism does n't work ! ' reality is : if my company does n't make money , they lay off tons of people . which they have done and continue to do . <br> <br> there should be incentive to keeping jobs in the us , and it should n't come at just a monetary price tag . unfortunately , it 's all about the money . and if there 's no money to be made here , then there 's no reason to have companies here . <br> <br> we have nothing to export . we do n't have tons of cheap labor . we ca n't survive on $ 2/day like they can in some of these nations . we 've built regulations into our system to protect our workers and our consumers . we ca n't just go throwing lead paint into toys and poisons into toothpaste to reduce the cost of production . <br> <br> unfortunately , as a result of this and the result of the ability to communicate and travel to far off nations there 's no incentive at all to have jobs here when you can make significantly more money doing it elsewhere . <br> <br> so yes , i believe we need some way to enforce some minor protectionism in our economy . i 'm not saying cut off completely import and export or anything of that nature . but i 'm saying there needs to be incentive to stay focused on our country . there 's nothing wrong with this . most other countries have a protectionist policy when it comes to their workforce and it works out very well for them .
POS christian bale kicks fucking ass !
NEG yeah , i 'm sure she gave it to one of her friends - i have some doubt that four high school senior girls from an upscale community all had their own cellphones . / sarcasm <br> <br> i 'm from rochester too . i always said -LRB- before texting came to be as big as it is -RRB- that it 's not talking on the phone while driving that 's a problem , it 's dialing . <br> <br>

NEG for most people , its a search engine , nothing more . for those stupid enough to have bought into the whole web 2.0 cloud bollocks then yes , they 're going to be in the shit . or not . those who will really be in the shit are the google doccers daft enough not to have local copies and corporates stupid enough to be running their email system on gmail . <br> <br> the rest of us will just go ` meh ' and use something else . <br> <br> i do n't use gmail , i do n't use google apps . if google disappeared completely , i 'd just click on the down arrow next to the google icon in the search box of firefox and choose another from the list , that 's how completely and utterly irrelevent google is in my life . if it 's there i 'll use it , if it is n't , i 'll use something else . recently though , i have been using something else - ixquick - and it seems to be better than google .
NEG daschle withdrew , so should the sect . of the treasury ...
NEG all of you idiot nutcases posting anti-marijuana propaganda from government websites , you need to watch a bbc documentary called should i smoke dope ? it was done by a journalist who compared pot to alcohol . she smoked different types , and performed all sorts of experiments while intoxicated . guess what ? everything that our government is telling us about pot is a lie , her conclusion was that pot is less harmful than alcohol .
NEG yeah , our money . where was all of the debate & discourse when the bailout bill was passed in a record wee 's time ? this is absurd . are we all so exhausted from being forecefully bent over we ca n't recognize when we 're being run over ?

POS no , games are n't responsible - we are responsible . it 's our choice ...
NEG incorrect ^ <br> <br> 1 -RRB- the evidence that suggests peds make a pitcher throw harder is substantially weak . the sentence you 're responding to -LRB- ` chemically enhanced pitches ' -RRB- was a figure of speech -- peds help pitchers reduce fatigue as the season wears on , thus making them more effective in the later months than they otherwise would be . example : ryan franklin 2003 . he had a career year where he was able to throw 200 + innings of quality pitching despite * zero * enhancement to his ` stuff , ' was busted in 2004 , and has since found starting significantly more difficult and has been relegated to a relief role . <br> <br> 2 -RRB- velocity induces * vastly * more swinging strikes than it does turning ordinary flyballs into home runs . if anything , a fastball with more zip on it because of peds would hurt barry more often that it would help him , as it would all hitters . <br> <br> ^ this sentence may be factually correct but the insinuation behind it is wrong .
NEG i us them and thy deliverd
NEG vitriolandangst , you said : ` cuba , is under a damn embargo from the us for the past 40 years . it has nothing to do with trade restrictions . ' <br> <br> an embargo is a set of trade restrictions . judging from your other incoherent comments in this thread , however , i 'll forgive your mistake as simply a product of your elementary nature . <br> <br> intrepidia is exactly right . relying only on domestic production is terrible for an economy . you can also check out north korea .

NEG ' i do n't want to be walking to the shops in fear that granny is packing . ' <br> <br> and what precisely do you have to fear from granny packing ? do you think that the instant someone starts carrying a firearm they become a ranting , raving , murderous maniac ? on the other hand , someone willing to commit the crime of murder probably is n't going to worry a whole lot about getting charged for an illegal gun , so any idiotic gun bans are n't going to do anything to stop them .

POS it looks like the sheep is laughing about it in the picture .
NEG the fact that it promotes islam is n't what 's shocking , it 's the fact that it 's ` hidden ' and not obviously a religious product . if it did say ` christianity is the light ' it would either be obvious on the front that it was religious , or it would probably be just as controversial . <br> <br> * edit * i did a bit of research , apparently there 's a lot of controversy over whether it 's actually saying ` islam is the light ' or not , so i have to say this is probably just a gross overreaction . grow up , soccer moms !

NEG it 's an economic trap !
NEG i do n't see how it matters who does the talking , so long as what 's said is true . both sides are largely comprised of stupid politicians or evil politicians pandering to stupid voters .
NEG blacklabelsar , i appreciate your desire to join in the pile-on , but in this case you 're wrong . i 'm fully aware that godwin 's law simply states the probability of a nazi reference , and nothing else . however , as i 'm sure you are aware , the most common corollary to godwin 's law is that whoever makes the nazi comparison loses the discussion . <br> <br> 99 % of the time when godwin 's law is invoked , the person using it means the corollary . i do n't think it 's necessary or helpful to force everybody to say , ` the most common corollary to godwin 's law ! you lose ! ' it 's pedantic and artificial , and nothing is gained by it . <br> <br> lastly , i think you should all be grateful to me for providing you with such a comedy goldmine .

NEG the first people hitler murdered on a large scale were the mentally handicapped as they did n't meet his expectations of a ` master race ' . the german people were furious and rose up against this aprobation and it soon stopped . the next group of people to be exterminated were not the jews or communists or homosexuals : it was the intelligentsia . the people who knew the program and where it was headed . some were teachers and university professors . today there are few teachers or professors in this country bright enough or deprogrammed enough to be a threat to anyone . however i was blessed to by surrounded by over 15,000 of the intelligentsia on 9/2/08 in st.paul , minnesota . and i knew it was just the tip of the iceberg . <br> hitler took everyone 's guns before the roundup so his pussy gestapo agents could do their job easier . does fema et al really think the real americans are as quick to surrender as the germans ? do they really think we 're going to go down without a fight ? <br> thanks for the post . do not stop talking about this to your fellow americans .

NEG are you thinking about those 10-10-220 , telephone commercials ? he talks about that here : <br> <br> ' i made an album in las vegas in the '60s , and a hippie friend said to me , ` man , you sold out . ' so i said , ` wait a minute , what is that over there ? ' and he said , ` it 's a phone , man . ' i said , ` that 's ma bell . you 're cooperating with them . you have one of their implements in your home . you sold out . ' by that i mean that this thing is on a scale . the alternative , the real pure path , is to live in the woods , make your own clothing , and perhaps eat small game , if you can catch it . you have to choose how much you 're willing to put up with for your purposes . so , i am a reluctant participant in the commercial world because that 's what they have here , that 's the way they keep score , and i 'm not about to go live in the woods . if this were a culture where everything was free , i would do this for free . i would go from campfire to campfire , dragging my stone tablet of jokes around for people to see in exchange for pieces of meat . it would be a nicer system . but that 's not the way it is . <br> that being said ... in the early '80s i discovered that i had made bad business decisions during the last half of the '70s and was deeply in debt to the irs . it was still 70 percent tax time . i was behind . the penalties and interest were burying me , and i had no career to speak of . so a friend of mine , a promoter , became my manager , and we began to dig out of this , and it 's taken me 20 years . when the people from 10-10-220 came to me , i said , ` well , it 's a phone service , it 's not a poison gas , it 's not gasoline , let me listen to these people . ' they gave me full creative control over the imagery and the content , and they wanted to use me doing my stand-up . so i made what i consider a compromise , or an adjustment . that 's my personal euphemism for it -- we all make adjustments to our value system according to our needs and what we can tolerate .

NEG the answer is tax cuts . <br> with them , it 's always tax cuts .
NEG i do n't care if you 're using a pelt gun . if you shoot at my house and keep shooting at my house while my family is in it and i 've told you to stop , and no one is willing to help me make you stop , i will take cover and freely use my rifle , shotgun and pistol to kill you . is that overkill ? <br> <br> shooting at me does begets a response .
NEG i 'd hit it . so hard .
NEG sodade , i used to be a stoner , that is why i am against it . it ruined my life , that is why i am against it . <br> i was also a victim of a drunk driver , and i am against alcohol . <br> do you need any more fucking explanation . <br> i do n't care who is productive and who is n't . i am against it for my own reasons , does it really bother you that someone is against it ? i mean , can you not live your life because of that ? <br> oh and not to mention that the people that i do know that smoke it , are dumber than a bunch of rocks in a bag , not only do they act stupid , but they 're also all criminals of some sort . just like i was . <br> <br> but i already said what i wanted , legalize all drugs . woooooo ! <br>

NEG the jewish nwo are the play makers , the muslims are their chosen players because they also have a dream of world domination . <br> support neither . <br> be allied to your constitution and people of your own ilk , and friends with nations of a similar make up . <br> cultural marxism seems to have blurred everything that the western world knew was right for it and its people . <br> the nwo agenda and the islamic agenda are both threatening to the west , the fact that they bounce one another off each other should be of no consequence to a nation that is basically under attack by both . <br> get nationalist , preserve and reinstate with vigor your constitution and the old american way of life.attack the perversity of cultural marxism , recognise it for the nation destroying disease that it is , understand how it works and how it was made to fool you out of your nationhood .

NEG jesus christ , why is everyone attatched to obama 's balls . he has n't done any good yet , and if anything his people are exactly what 's wrong with our government . <br> <br> goddamn cocksuckers and politicians <br> <br> go sharks !
NEG ... but the ball is attached to the cup with a string , so it ca n't go anywhere .
NEG wow , that site is incredibly similar to lifehacker .
NEG dear natural selection , please do your job asap , thanks .
NEG ` even if he is innocent . ' <br> innocent ? do you not understand the concept of a court of law ? y ` see what happens is the defendent is put on trial . evidence against him is presented . if this evidence does n't hold up he is released without charge . i think i 'm going to have to repeat this for you : if he 's innocent , he has nothing to worry about . the point is you could n't give two sh * ts whether he 's guilty or not , you want him off the hook . <br> <br> ` abused by arab immigrants ' <br> this article fails to mention amnesty is the one building the cases against israel 's war crimes . i take it amnesty is made up entirely of arab immigrants is it ? perhaps i should further explain the concept of a court of law . the idea is that an impartial party known as the judge ultimately makes the decision weighing up the evidence for and against . the arab ` barbarians at the gates ' do n't get to clump together and vote on who is guilty and who is not . <br> <br> here 's your problem mate <br>
POS actually need to start looking for valentine 's gifts .
NEG if looking at this entirely from a practical standpoint , obama could wear a leopard speedo -LRB- and as long as he feels secure in it -RRB- , do the job to the best of his ability . <br> <br> however , professional dress codes , regardless of personal comfort , are required for many of us.for senior executives doing business with the sleeves up is done behind closed doors , only in front of high ranking internal staff . ultimately our president is america 's chief executive . while we may not give a shit , his appearance factors into the perception that his peers carry -LRB- in america and abroad -RRB- regarding his respect for them , himself and the people he represents .
POS cool , sounds like that one feature from gamevee .
NEG what the fuck .
NEG * cocks shotgun *
NEG we have only ourselves to blame . if i remember correctly , we are a republic , and as long as the incumbents continues to give their constituents what they want , no matter how short sighted the gains , then they will continue to get elected . let 's face it , we 're a nation of spoiled , selfish children for the most part .
NEG i watched all of that . i hated every minute of it , but i could n't stop . it was like driving by a car accident . you do n't want to slow down and look , but you just cant help yourself . except this time the accident involves a clown car , a transsexual hooker , and a squad of very bored cheer leaders . <br> <br> god damn if we did n't do a number on japan with the atom bomb .
POS lol !
NEG that 's ok . if you do n't want to boycott . your statement makes the specific point of ` choice ' . should n't a company stay away from moral issues ? but then again maybe not . in either case i stand by your decision . i 'm not going to buy their products because i know that marijuana is not a bad plant .
NEG these critics are completely off-base with their assessments . <br> <br> i know that the digg community loves lists , but if more than1000 people wind up digging this article , it will be a sad day .
NEG great commentary , but i do n't want cheney to leave the country . i want both bush & cheney to have their family assets seized to help pay for some of the destruction they caused . then i want them both held accountable for their crimes -LRB- too many to list -RRB- . <br>
NEG national socially responsible health care !!! <br> whatwe need is nationalized health care that keeps all of the money sucking fat companies totally out of it . all the health care costs should be borne by the country itself since too much time and money is spent figuring out who is responsible for all the carcinogens , pesticides , and everything else in the country that has unknown side effects . and then adding profit margins , advertising , legal costs , ceo benefits onto the cost . not only that the profit motive makes the first priority of any company the avoidance of coverage as much as possible . that is an insane approach to the health and welfare of a nation and it 's national security . as we know we are all affected by the lack of treatment of diseases of everyone else ! in an interdependent system everyone needs to have good coverage . <br> it also seems to call in question the motivation of any form of insurance . <br>

NEG i hate both teams so i can be honest . <br> <br> ray ray was shoved before he took the shot . it should have been a foul on the floor . i 'm not quite sure what the bonus was at that time . <br> <br> and saying that the game would not be close of someone shot better -LRB- from any angle -RRB- is like not saying anything . so do n't .
NEG religion is the anchor of moral society ! and as moral society is forced to drag that anchor in it 's quest for progress .
NEG while these are all good points , if it is n't a project designed to be begun and completed in the short term then it is n't economic stimulus . that would be regular infrastructure building and such spending should be considered in other normal budgetary spending matters . the argument that ` this is our big chance to get a huge chunk of money ' does n't fly , we should not be any less critical of the spending in the stimulus package than we would be spending in the federal budget .
NEG katt williams , we 're coming for you ! <br> <br> signed , the dea

NEG 5 dollar foot long
NEG quick lets pass another hurried bailout bill !
NEG sheesh , i thought the fight was tough in cali .
NEG ` thats the point ! ' <br> i am so happy to have the president stand up for the real world . a stimulus is spending . you can spend it on good things that create jobs or stupid things -LRB- like simple rebate checks -RRB- that do n't . that is a good debate . but 40 republican lawmakers do n't believe this simple fact and voted to remove all spending and replace it with huge tax cuts for rich individuals ! where is the middle ground with that ?
POS dugg for the title .

NEG where 's mr. eastwood and his m1 when you need him ?
NEG i guess they are planning to bailout their penises with our money .
NEG when i first read the headline , i thought he was just stopped several times by several different officers . i was a little disappointed that it was just one long event . <br> <br> question : did he break any records ?
NEG yeah , barely any new intellectual properties , but there 's always a few surprises so we 'll have to wait and see .
NEG wow , boner killer
NEG democrats on here trying to act like only the republicans lie ... wow you all are so naive ... almost all the people in washington lie . this happens to cover about the stupidest lie that had little impact on anything of any lie ever committed in washington . learn to pick your fights better . argue the war . . but getting riled up over this just shows you blow everything the bush admin did way out of proportion .
NEG is n't twitter the name for a vibrating butt-plug ?
NEG you know , bush had a 23 % approval rating .
NEG there 's no shame in failing a driving test a couple times , but 771 ???? she must be a complete idiot , because no driving test is beyond memorization . we 're not talking 5 or 6 tries , seven-hundred and seventy-one . come on woman ! get your head out of your ass !!!

NEG the only thing that surprises me about this story is that there is still a station carrying air america . who knew ?
NEG so this is just as useless as the vista ads ?
NEG i said this so long ago when houstonpress had 2 back to back articles that were just slideshows of about 100 photos or so , something that would never have made the frontpage because it required reloading the page 100 or moreso times to go through the set . also the site went from literally obscure to suddenly extremely popular with only recent submissions - as in no previous articles submitted from the site .
NEG would n't classify that as a debate ... he basically dumbs himself down enough to make anyone who ask him a serious question an ass . he really made tucker look like an ass but at the same point he ca n't answer a serious question with a serious answer .
NEG blu ray , the long run , is irrelevant , but it looks nice now . blu ray will * never * overtake dvd . vod will take over before then , easily .
NEG remember the vikings ?
NEG and though you die , la resistance lives on .
NEG actually , in this time of economic hardship , it is good for the country to have a leader to look up to . obama 's mere presence in office is restoring american faith in the economy and will help to make things better . he is not an over night cure but he does a good job of giving us the faith in america we need right now . <br> <br> btw . as an obama supporter , i would be behind mccain had he won because we need a leader at this time in history and anyone willing to do the job deserves respect and admiration .
NEG ramen is 10 cents a packet . you are splitting 10 ramen between 10 people .
NEG , did you read this article ? or was it over your head ?
NEG ` the wording of stimulus bill says that government bailout money can not be used for churches -- it does not ban religious worship . ' <br> <br> the wording of the bill said nothing of the kind . i suggest you actually read the text of those couple of lines that demint was questioning , in context with the entire section of the american recovery and reinvestment act . <br> <br> priority funding is given to higher education facilities that have been included in a declared emergency . all the funds are administered through the state departments of higher education , and distributed in proportion to the number of students at each school . <br> <br> all schools receiving grants have to commit to spending 25 percent of the grant to projects that are certifiable under ` green ' building standards , such as the leed green building system , etc. . <br> <br> the grants are to be used for a wide variety of renovations and improvements ' ... that are primarily used for instruction , research , or student housing ... ' <br> <br> except <br> <br> -LRB- a -RRB- the maintenance of systems , equipment , or facilities , including maintenance associated with any permissible uses of funds described in paragraph -LRB- 1 -RRB- ; <br> <br> -LRB- b -RRB- modernization , renovation , or repair of stadiums or other facilities primarily used for athletic contests or exhibitions or other events for which admission is charged to the general public ; <br> <br> -LRB- c -RRB- modernization , renovation , or repair of facilities -- <br> <br> -LRB- i -RRB- used for sectarian instruction , religious worship , or a school or department of divinity ; or <br> <br> -LRB- ii -RRB- in which a substantial portion of the functions of the facilities are subsumed in a religious mission ; or <br> <br> -LRB- d -RRB- construction of new facilities . <br> <br> <br> so , while the money can be used for projects in facilities that are primarily used for instruction ... if the facility is primarily used for instruction in religion -LRB- such as a school of divinity -RRB- , then the grant money can not be used to renovate or improve that facility . at least 25 percent of the grant money has to be spent on green building projects . <br> <br> i 'm not certain if that bit in the bill is discriminatory , though it seems likely , as the wording is vague -LRB- how much usage is ` substantial ' ? -RRB- ; the government withholds money that would be granted for improvements to facilities used for any other type of instruction . <br> <br> not exactly equal treatment under the eyes of the lawmakers . <br> <br> demint appears to have been grandstanding with his proposed amendment : <br> <br> ` to allow the free exercise of religion at institutions of higher education that receive funding under section 803 of division a ' <br> <br> that said , i think the entire bill is a travesty , as you do n't get out of debt by digging ever deeper into your creditor 's pockets . <br> <br> the complete text of the bill : <br>
NEG no investigation because - the ag is a regular client ? the ag 's brother is a regular client ? the ag 's best friends are regular clients ? do i have to go on ?
NEG '' what executives have done is troubling , but it 's equally troubling to have government telling shareholders how much they can pay the executives , ' said sen. mel martinez -LRB- r-fl -RRB- .

NEG exactly . people do n't give kids medication in the best interest of the child . they do it in the best interest of the parents . it 's a lot of work for a parent to raise a child that is able to function well in society despite any disorders he may have . much easier to feed him some pills .
NEG the corn industry deliberately confused everybody in order to make a shitload of money off the subsidies . reasonable biofuel methods are sustainable . for example growing algae on sewage .

NEG <br> all the more reason to support the platform . the ` core gamer ' on wii is as close as you can get to an untapped audience this generation and so wise developers are going to try and use that to their advantage .
NEG there have been players who have cheated , bragged about cheating , got caught and punished , and still made it into the hall . <br> <br> optimally , you 'd be able to easily tell who 's in the hall and cheated and kick them out . then gather all that are eligible , find out if they cheated in any form , and let them pass through if they did n't . after that , make anyone who 's found cheating automatically ineligible . <br> <br> but the first part of that is impossible . so other than doing the impossible , there are going to be some cheaters who receive preferential treatment over others . and that 's bullshit . <br> <br> it 's fucked any way you slice it .
NEG while i disagree with ending the death penalty entirely , i certainly see a need to make it harder to impose . i have thought for a long time that we need a higher standard of ` proof ' than the ` beyond a reasonable doubt ' convictions we have right now . it is an overused word , but there are some jackals out there that are truly deserving of the word ` monster ' and when those deserving few are caught and ` scientifically ' proven to be guilty , our world is better off with them dead . <br> <br> would it help to have a full review the case after a conviction , but before the sentencing ? make sure the conduct of the police was completely above board , the prosecutors actually turned over all evidence as required , the defense was competent , the judge had no conflict of interest or political agenda and all the forensic tests were done by certified techs on properly calibrated equipment , etc. the conduct of all involved needs to be examined and if it is n't completely above reproach , then the death penalty is off the table and life without parole becomes the maximum sentence .

NEG my heart hurts for this family . i feel for both partners , and their children . we live in ca , and in a non-religious hospital i was very disappointed when hospital staff refused to answer my questions as to my partner 's emergency room visit , which was under circumstances much less severe than what happened to the family in this article . the lgbt community faces so much discrimination and lack of respect in so many ways . the fact that this family did all they legally could , had all the right paperwork not to mention the legal expenses that go along with all of that , not to mention 17 years of life shared together and still their was no regard for their relationship , and the fact that they were a ` family ' by hospital staff when one of them was dying , scares the shit out of me , the doma laws need to be repealed . i think the involved hospital staff , and the heads of the hospital should all have to go through diversity sensitivity classes , and i hope the hospital looses this case and has to pay the family an exorbitant amount of money . sometimes the pocketbook is the best place to hit in order for such lessons to be learned .
POS awesome guitar player !

POS is the pope a catholic ? he is and yes , sex sells , it always has and always will !
NEG misleading ? perhaps , but do n't judge the speaker harshly . it 's rather difficult to explain it succinctly and accurately to the layman . let me give it a shot . <br> <br> the fact is all our best descriptions of the universe treat time and space on a very similar footing . you may choose not to call time a dimension ; words are just words , so that 's your perogative . but in fact time is something very similar to a dimension , and in the mathematical sense of the word it certainly qualifies . <br> <br> in fact the basic difference is , time has a ` minus ' sign in a couple of key equations , while the three space dimensions each have a ` plus ' sign . -LRB- well , the other difference is it 's measured in years instead of meters , but that problem 's solvable . one light year is fundamentally one ` year ' of distance ; that 's why physicists use light years ! -RRB- <br> <br> now it 's true , that minus sign makes time a very different beast from space . but in a mathematical sense it 's still a dimension , and spacetime is a four-dimensional manifold of some strange structure we do n't know everything about yet .
NEG is that all of them ? it does n't seem like that many for the whole internet .
NEG now i have a reason to never go to subway , to eat its shitty subs .

NEG the solution to our problem is to collapse as a nation . people never realize the problem until its too late . that is perhaps the best medicine . <br> <br> change is such a minor thing , the change anyone was preaching is only the difference of raising or lowering taxes . <br> <br> we needed a revolution not some rabbit crap like change . <br>

NEG : a rented apartment and a popular car are definitely not considered luxury in brazil . there are a lot of poor people in brazil , but more than half of the population can afford such things . <br> <br> middle class is very alive in brazil , especially in the last few years . <br> <br> perhaps you think brazil is a huge slum -LRB- as you might have seen in city of god -RRB- and a decent home is rare thing around here . this is far , far away from reality . more than half of brazilians can afford an apartment , a popular or second-hand car , a flat-screen tv , computers -LRB- as stevemax said -RRB- and they 're not considered luxury . <br> <br> if you 're talking about these luxuries in a world level -LRB- damn , even a hot shower is considered a luxury -RRB- then i agree with you . but i 'm just saying at brazil .

NEG oooooo.gruesome . i shall make it my desktop on my work computer .
NEG wait !!!! heath 's dead ?!?!?! laugh out loud wow ... these people seriously want the joker to never be portrayed again on the big screen ? i assume they do n't want anymore gay cowboys either ? lol ... as much as i loved heath 's performance as the joker -LRB- and i really mean it , had my doubts , but he truly won be over -RRB- ... the fact of the matter is i like watched the caped crusader fight the joker ... i feel the reason why heath 's performance was so ` amazing ' was cause we have never had a joker role that was truly meant to be dark , terrifying , and devilishly evil . I do n't know what runs through peoples head though , even if this does have justification it will never happen .
NEG it 's not even about the hardware vista is just a memory hog , but at $ 20 a gig i fail to see where the problem is . can you even get a computer with less than 1gb of ram now ?

NEG america , with all her faults , is still a very free country . <br> <br> <br> in america if a woman is ganged up on by 4 men , it 's usually while you are fapping and she was paid for being on the dvd . <br> <br> <br> in saudi arabia , if a woman is ganged up on by 4 men , it 's her fault and she gets whipped .

NEG presumably you 're talking the laffer curve , so then you 'd know that after a certain optimal taxation rate revenues would start to decrease as tax rates are lowered . <br> <br> knowing this , maybe you can tell me the difference between dropping the top marginal tax rate from 90 % -LRB- as kennedy did -RRB- and dropping the present top tax rate from 35 % . <br> <br> do you think there might be a different effect ?
NEG it would be the height of hypocrisy to dump a-roid now just because what the yankees knew full well privately when they signed him is now confirmed publicly . <br> <br> is there any mystery when a former texas player shows up dirty ? can you say sosa , palmero , pudge rodriguez , ken caminiti and of course the poster boy canseco ? <br> <br> just who the hell was running that club , anyway ? whoever it was must be a major league a-hole . i hope nobody like that ends up with a position of any real influence ...

NEG thanks for your input lemur . many of the diggers do n't understand the culture and associate or stereotype all of islam based on actions found in saudi arabia . an equal justification would be the saudi arabians to call every christian pedophiles for sexually assaulting young children . or to chastise us politicians for viewing child pornography .
POS people need to understand -LRB- and i know there 's a vast majority who already do -RRB- that guns do not kill people . years ago -LRB- i do n't know like 100 -RRB- children could buy guns , there was barely any restriction on guns and there were less killings than now . it 's people with their ideals and motivations that kill .

NEG ` thank god laserdisc did n't catch on ' <br> <br> wtf ? first of all , it pretty much outlasted vhs . more importantly , it was about the best consumer-electronics product ever . at a time when video tape had barely made it into homes , philips and pioneer had the guts to develop and commercialize a laser-based optical disc system . in the '70s . let 's see : uncompressed video , stereo -LRB- and , later , dolby ac-3 -RRB- sound , directors ' cuts , extras -LRB- some even had the entire script of the film on the disc -RRB- . and no wear . and selling for $ 35 per movie , when crappy , mono , quickly worn-out vhs tapes were selling for $ 100 . <br> <br> laserdisc could have topped dvd 's picture quality if it had offered anamorphic and progressive images , because it was uncompressed . its primary disadvantage would 've been video noise level . <br> <br> hopefully your friends and family do n't rely on you for electronics advice .

NEG i feel sorry for you 360 owners , one day you 'll be able to afford a real pc .
NEG wrong there have been almost no war in which the 2 sides had the same religion .
NEG i 'm on the side of the free staters , you ninnies ! house resolutions are one thing . actually defending yourself from a belligerent federal government is something else entirely . several states have brought up this ` declare sovereignty ' thing and what does it change ? they all still take federal money for their schools , permit unconstitutional federal agencies to meddle in their citizens ' lives , and roll over for the exact same jurisdictional power grabs as always . <br> <br> what a state * really * needs to do in order for all this celebrating to be justified , is to pass a law that flies directly in the face of unconstitutional federal policies , and back it up with lethal force . for example , new hampshire could decriminalize marijuana , and arrest any federal agent that attempts to harass anyone for possession .

NEG what amazes me is why this is on digg ? vw bluemotion cars have been around for years .
NEG it does n't have to be a nonprofit , or big volunteer effort . it 's the little miracles , the little bits of compassion and energy that we give to others that accumulate in personal excellence everyday and amount to growth of character and strength in spirit . do unto others is not just an adage but a way of being . and this is n't just for weekend warriors . think about it the next time you step over a homeless person in the street on your way to where ever .
NEG the final statement shows that the chief is more concerned about damage control and protecting his ` brothers ' than what really happened on that video . a history of violence does n't excuse excessive force by the officers on that day . i wish more police actually care about justice .
NEG ha , that 's a fucking accomplishment right there . finding few-year-old files , it 's quite impressive , although understandable . <br> <br> the biggest fuck up i 've had was accidentally the whole hard drive . i was actuall going to a floppy drive , but i was talking on the phone , distracted , selected the wrong drive , and few clicks later , my hard drive was formatted . i realized that when i saw that file system was set to ntfs , and i was like ` ntfs on a floppy ? wtf ? ' a microsecond later i felt like shooting myself . <br> <br> 80gb of data , including downloads , mp3s , movies . over 48 hours trying to recover that shit . i got back like 50 % , mostly due to the lack of decent free software at the time .

NEG it is so much more than a media player , and the player part comes unlocked . can vlc render straight into a podcast format ? can it create . mov and . m4v ? mixed with flip4mac can it render . wmv ? can windows movie player do any of the above ? <br> <br> actually can the rather otherwise awesome widows media tool you can download for free convert into . mov or . m4v ? i think not , wether you pay extra or not . <br> <br> i paid for it , and have used it 's features to make money since . ca n't remember last time i used it to watch a video , and their lies the reasoning i 'm sure . <br> <br> if it 's unlocked , i wuld have thought watching video through itunes on a mac is making quicktime irrelevant except for rendering video or watching . wmv -LRB- a format that is quickly being made pointless -RRB- . quicktime pro mixed with flip4mac studio is an incredibly powerful and inexpensive tool for a video maker . <br> <br> frankly , people moaning about quicktime are not using it to full potential ... or are mac haters jumping on their silly bandwagon . <br> <br> no idea what you are talking about people . <br> <br>
NEG i believe it 's spelled ` respeck ' .

NEG if your own community is filled with selfish folks like yourself , not willing to help out -LRB- note : i did n't say give up your own food supply -RRB- your fellow neighbors , then you guys wo n't last a year . <br> <br> good luck to you .
NEG <br> 1 out of 6 is some progress <br> <br> / no , even mcdonald 's salads and apple slices have 24 grams of trans-fat . xd
NEG if we use california as a microcosim of what liberal government can do -LRB- do n't even try to claim that schwarzy is a real conservative -RRB- then i think we can clearly see where the us will be after 8 years of obama . i do n't know what kind of weed they smoke in washington but the idea that we can spend -LRB- aka print -RRB- our way out of this is patently retarded . the government can not fix with one payment what it has spent 40 years creating with bad legislation and spending . sadly even ending the war really wo n't help . sure we 'd save all those billions by not having troops abroad , but then we 'd have all those troop back home ... looking for jobs ... where there are n't any .
NEG is it just me or does a guy say ` fuck you ' during the news report when they switch to the blond girl ?
NEG also notice in commericals now that any ` bad person ' is a 30 something clean cut white male . they got them breaking into houses and taking a break from jogging to sift through your trash to steal your identity .
NEG enough with the hate-mongering . anything that panders to a stereotype is not ` hate speech ' . yes , women have pms . yes , men double up if they get kicked in the balls . neither observation is hateful . <br> <br> most of these commercials would work well enough with a man/boy as the protagonist too . they are not sexist , just implying their customers are dumb . i remember a commercial where a man was apparently too dumb to work a water filter , and the woman showed him how , smugly . that is sexist , but apparently there is only outcry if the roles are reversed . -LRB- of course , it would be sexist the other way round too -RRB- <br> <br> and of course , i concede the polyglas tire one is completely sexist and demeaning , but how old does that have to be , 40 years or more ?
NEG found this pretty interesting : <br> <br> male bashing in tv <br> <br> just shows how a lot of comedies/sitcoms have a male lead who is an idiot/poor parent/etc . and how in between the commercials have an anti-man vibe to em . <br> <br> thought it was interesting to go against the tv hates women vein .

POS poitier was the man .
NEG down in orange county the cops just ship the homeless off from the rich neighborhoods -LRB- irvine -RRB- to the poorer cities -LRB- santa ana -RRB-
NEG no . it 's not . what we have here are bad decisions by people playing with money that is not theirs . then , when the bill comes due , we get forced to pay for their bad decisions . the only way out of this spiral is called fiscal responsibility . which is n't going to happen as long as we worship greed in this country .
NEG like fdr said : we have to ` make -LSB- them -RSB- do it . '
NEG perhaps you should focus your anger less on this ` piece of shit ' show and more on your diminutive brain size ? it seems this show is much too complicated for someone of your iq to comprehend .

POS laugh out loud at their pricing scheme ... quarterly payments of x % of the developer 's sales . .
POS good post darcine ! there are whiners on the left and blowhards on the right - but they need each other . they cancel each other out and keep each other in check . this causes the nation to be centrist over time . <br> <br> benjamin franklin knew this and talked about it frequently .
NEG . net should be ditched and mono should rise , meaning c people should code toward mono and not . net . in term what this will do is force microsoft out of ownership of the c coding language . then by c having no owner it can become as standard as c or c++ that in terms will help developers and ` all ' users . <br> <br> i admit i had a problem against c because the fact . net , closed and propetiary , is the main implementation of it . though with an open implementation combo of c / gtk / qt -LRB- its called something else -RRB- i noticed this is actually a good thing , except for the fact mono is trying ot be a 100 % clone of . net and not try to surpass it that is an issue . <br> <br> basically what i want to see happen with mono is that it integrates functions and parts from all over into it , basically anyone who builds extentions to mono-c do n't hesitate to begin integrating these things in the mainline design . <br> <br> so pretty much if mono continues to be brain dead step child of . net then i ca n't truly support c , but if people force mono as the c standard then its well worth it .
NEG nice to see all the huffpo tards are getting paid to game digg .
NEG i suspect they watched the movie ' 21 ' too many times . unfortunately because they suck at math , they devised their own ` genius ' way of becoming infamous . it 's too bad they did n't have kate bosworth with them to tell them when to get out .

NEG in order to get gregg to sign on , obama promised gregg he would get the pork out of the so-called stimulus , and he would do a fair and square census . when the grievance mongers started squealing , obama went back on the census promise and turned it over to rahm ` hit-man ' emmanuel . no warning to gregg . then pork-a palooza happened , with obama fighting for every slice of bacon . gregg figured out obama could n't be trusted , and he got out while the getting was good .

NEG there 's a chapter in the book freakonomics all about drug gang business structure and economics . <br> <br> basically , it 's a franchise system , much like macdonalds , with the street dealers = burger flipping johnny no-stars on $ 4/hr , franchise managers = bmw driving execs , and columbians as ceos . <br> <br> <br>
NEG okay he wants to temporarily take them over , well that makes it much better / s <br> <br> one thing i 've learned is once power is in washington it is very hard to get back . give them an inch and they take a mile , look at the patriot act , income tax ... he is putting way too much trust in a government/party he is sceptical of . i 'm sorry , it wo n't work and if they get control of the banks they will not give them up without a fight .

NEG the basis for comparison does n't hold up . a regular user can go trough 3 lines of coke in about as much time as a drunk takes a swig of beer . so it might be $ 4 - $ 8 a line but you 'll end up doing 15-20 a night -LRB- a cokehead 's night can end at 3 pm the next day -RRB- so if you say that the average drunk will drink 10 beers in a night at about $ 5 a beer . the cokehead can be out anywhere from 10 - 110 bucks a night over someone just drinking . so it is definitely not cheaper than beer in a real sense .
NEG but where is the mac mini ? i only see a dell .
NEG if federal law requires you to sign up that 's it unless ohio changes its law .
NEG this is truly a shame . cambodia was traditionally one place that was welcoming to gay families wishing to adopt .
NEG dood , you 're making us look bad .
NEG obama is such a crook . try to fix the results . this looks more and more like a communist country .
NEG for a 3k computer that person had better be jumping in the way of that coffee like a secret service agent protecting the president .
NEG i just let one fly next to a big tv satellite - is that going to be a problem at all ?
NEG yay , another article where all the digg men say all women are crazy , batshit cunts , and there are no good ones .
NEG more like letting your kid shit all over your couch and then showing him the toilet .
NEG my name is . . slim shady
NEG you find the perfect girl , ready to pop the question , then find out she has $ 150,000 in student loans , $ 40k in credit card debt and a credit rating thats in the toilet . <br> <br> no , rich is n't necessary , just not a financial weight so heavy that it could sink the titanic . <br> <br> if she can screw her own finances with ease , what do you think will happen once you get married ?
NEG i 'm going to go out and get another gun ... . and lots of bullets .
NEG what does that mean ?
NEG a trillion here , a trillion there , soon it is going to start adding up to serious money . <br> <br> / sarcasm
NEG ray comfort is a joke . he had his ass handed to him by the rational response squad debate .

NEG what 's the difference between energy drinks and coffee ?
NEG democracy is dead . our government killed it and we the people did not revolt and overthrow these tyrants . there is no hope for humanity .
NEG i 'm right there with you , in addition i feel i have a moral obligation -LRB- yes , morals have nothing to do with religion -RRB- to point out the wrong doings of religion . it 's just not right to control people through their insecurities about life and fear of death . <br> <br> ' i call christianity the one great curse , the one great intrinsic depravity , the one great instinct of revenge , for which no means are venomous enough , or secret , subterranean and small enough - i call it the one immortal blemish upon the human race . ' - nietzsche -LRB- and i agree with him -RRB-
NEG i study in law school and have been to a few criminal law classes . studies show that certain psychiatric treatments do lower the change of re-offending on specif group of convicted criminals . these kinds of programs are n't really used in the usa since its criminal justice system has opted for the punishment angle instead of the rehabilitation angle .
NEG do n't blame me , i voted for ron paul .
NEG news like this really does isolate a certain group of people ... i saw this coming several hundred thousand seconds ago , and i knew it would be here on digg
NEG there 's no way pirate bay could be punished . technically they are like google . they just index the torrent meta files . if they were based in united states , they might to have act on dmca notices but they are in sweden so .
NEG laugh out loud her life is wasted now
NEG paul krugman ?! are you serious ?! he 's the guy who says obama 's stimulus bill is n't big enough . no only that , he worked for enron ffs ! ca n't believe they gave him a nobel prize . . what a joke . <br> <br> keynesianism is going to die along with the american economy and you 're going to wish you had listened to people like ron paul and peter schiff .
NEG if you 're going to compare platforms , umm windows mobile ?
NEG ` his original plan for fighting slavery was to ensure that it did not spread beyond the pre-existing slave states . ' <br> if you really believe that , you should read up on the corwin amendment , which lincoln favoured .
NEG generation rescue 's data is bullshit junk science , generated to prove a specific point . it has no weight in any discussion .
NEG but how is it doing on the torrent charts ?
NEG worst day ! = bad day .
POS that 's better .
NEG they should take tips from boston.com
NEG i 'm not that surprised that a republican is in support of this . <br> <br> remember this one .
NEG norad tracks everything over 3 inches in diameter , there are many many more dots on the full tracker , even with 1 pixel representations it is quite the cloud ...
NEG what ?
POS quantum mechanical theory is not limited to experience . <br> <br> is it science , or not ? <br> <br> -LRB- see , i knew someone would bring that up , and yet there is the answer . qm is undoubtedly science , and not limited to human experience -RRB- .
NEG they try that every year and failed . every year they try . <br> <br> well . . there always oaksterdam
POS happy valentine 's day !
NEG yep , did n't need a digger to tell me that .
POS they will be as fast as kenyans
POS go kevin !
POS its a great action and suspense movie also download songs for free
POS do you support setting up an ellis island on the southern border so they can get documented right away in order to be here legally ?
NEG based on all i 've seen regarding zombies , i 've learned that the best course of action when zombie apocalypse is impending is to just bite the barrel . <br> <br> or find a hot zombie and chain her up in your basement . it 's not rape if they 're undead ...
NEG this is what the australian federal government wants to put onto every australian internet user and it 'll be a mandatory filter with a opt-out filter on top of it , this madness of the highest order , complete foolishness but the government is n't listening to the voters for reasons best known to others .
NEG * questions ... like this ?
POS that is actually a really good question even though you were just kidding around -LRB- or was it that bad ? -RRB- . i am currently working on a undergrad psych degree and the issue of implanting false memories has come up in many of my courses , but nothing has ever been mentioned about making someone forget past memories . although i suppose you can try to suppress your past memories on your own if you believe in that whole freudian thing .
POS we are the final boss .
NEG who gives a crap ! i love google , it does what i need it to do and i use gmail entirely for my email needs . anyone who bitch and moans about google being in ` beta ' will bitch and moan about it even if it is the final release . they always want to hate something ... if this was apple i bet they will say how much innovation it is that apple stays in beta forever ... new people suck !
NEG you can say that about anything . if you 're so worried about malaria , sell your computer and get volunteering .
NEG i posted this to the wrong video . it should have gone to the video the opelz posted just about this one . i do n't know how it happened . <br> <br> i am ashamed . EMO_HAPPY
NEG i have come to the conclusion that every god damned person on the internet slept through the section of their english class that covers proper use of the apostrophe . <br> <br> fear 's = possessive case - fear becomes the object in possession . -LRB- incorrect , as ` fear 's ' is a noun in this case -RRB- <br> fears = verb , ` fears ' gives action to taliban , making the sentence complete . -LRB- also incorrect ... -RRB- <br> fear = verb , but now in singular form . -LRB- correct case -RRB- <br> <br> so not only was the apostrophe not needed , but the plural form was incorrect as well . <br> <br> i realize there are other errors , but i am getting really fucking sick of people ignoring basic grammar principles and bastardizing the english language . normally i can handle the occasional slip-up , but this shit is seriously getting out of control .
NEG yeah i know kind of raging at all of the comments claiming they would murder the stupid kid over a cat <br> <br> maybe i just do n't have the love for felines you people do after seeing the remains of a baby killed by a cat
NEG that movie has so outrageous errors it is funny in a ` plan 9 from outer space ' kind of way . <br> freezing cold air from the top of the clouds comes down and shock freezes everything , because suddenly the basic laws of thermodynamics stop applying and the air stays cold despite the higher pressure on the ground . .
NEG b00m headshot !
NEG they had a new one after the movie with the town in shambles ...
NEG ' i predict future happiness for americans if they can prevent the government from wasting the labors of the people under the pretense of taking care of them . ' <br> <br> ` when the people fear their government , there is tyranny ; when the government fears the people , there is liberty . ' <br> <br> - thomas jefferson
NEG two things . the natural cycles take hundreds of thousands of years , not tens of years . <br> <br> secondly a rise of , say , 4 degrees centigrade is pretty much game over for society as we know it . <br> <br> common sense is no substitute for knowledge , as you 've just proved .
NEG from wikipedia : <br> kde 4.0 released - 11 january 2008 <br> <br> who 's copying who now ?
NEG no , do n't they . and will never
NEG you 're an idiot , zendez1 . you have no idea what you are talking about . do you honestly care what happens to these assholes ? personally , i would n't feel bad if they got killed somehow .
POS that ` yummy ' theme looks like a tiger app . the default theme looks correctly leopard-ish .
NEG die
POS made in the us ;--RRB-
NEG honestly i really hope these idiots get whats coming to them , this is just so wrong on sooo many levels , i really hope they dont get just a slap on the wrist they need some serious consequences !
NEG guess that ` splains the comment getting dugg down ... <br> <br> i forget sometimes that mob mentality rules , even on teh internets <br> <br>
POS i do n't work . i do n't have kids . i do what i want , when i want - i am free .
NEG it would also go against richard dawkins ' beliefs .
NEG several links to ireporter pages have already been linked in the comments . <br>
POS the truth is out there
NEG a clever joke , but never tell it again if you ever want to have sex with a woman .
NEG that 's what she said
NEG only 15 comments ... quick sickthoughts ... think of something intelligent to say ... . <br> <br> i can has comment diggs ?
NEG i thought it meant ` quoted for truth ' .
NEG i 'm still waiting for ms cofee .
NEG why make jokes , family guy writers ? just reference a stupid internet meme and the millions -LRB- ? -RRB- of idiotic fans will go nuts !
NEG needs more bacon
POS 100 billion trillion earth-like planets containing life . amazing . now how about the other planets that have sentience that is n't defined by the term of ` life ' as we know it ?
NEG amazing -- the power of an orbiting fleck of paint . the velocities these particles achieve is astounding . it would seem that ` kessler ' was right - and attention needs to be given to the space debris problem . somehow , i ca n't quite avoid picturing a scenario where warring countries decide to blow up each other 's communications satellites . a lot of our military weaponry and defense systems rely on satellites for gps and remote controls , and our abm systems depend on an intact communication system . so far , russia , us , and china have all shown that they can blow a satellite to smithereens . so if star wars ever gets here , there will likely be too much resulting particulate matter for normal space capability to survive .
NEG i dugg you up , and then read ' i am sure anyone who behaves like this has suffered much to become like they are . ' and promptly dugg you back down . <br> <br> no , this kid probably did n't suffer fuck all . chances are this kid is a sociopath . even if he did suffer in life , it 's no fucking excuse for this .
POS can there please be a blue screen of death theme park ride ? please ?
NEG also known as a ` mini-layoff '
NEG and you wonder how the nazi 's could find people to run they 're camps . i 'm appalled to why the military did not protect the people from a government that behaves like this . when basic liberties are removed and enforced this way by the government and military its own people are the next victims . how many young dead americans soldiers now ? the military should invade that ranch in texas instead and go after the real problems ...
NEG obama stated many times on his campaign that he wanted to give more funding to churches and to empower them to help to their communities . i do n't know why anybody is surprised by this move . did you actually listen to what obama was saying and read about his policy during the campaign or just buy into the ultra left wing image that the media and republicans painted of him ? <br> <br> also , despite what you may think , most churces are not the rabid evangelical type and do a lot of good for their communities , especially in inner cities . obama made his early political career as a community organizer working alongside churches . this is exactly in line with his character .
NEG how many times did the article mention ` occupation ' ? <br> <br> zero .
POS mccain has run for president several times and refused to release his records from college or the military . dumbya did n't release his either , they were leaked . we still have n't seen that glowing record of his awol years from the national guard . <br> <br> an no one , i mean no one is even considered for harvard law without exceptional records . to be on the harvard law review is reserved for only the top students and to be top dog , editor , we can safely assume that obama never took a ` history of television ' course in under grad for an easy grad and that he never received as much as an a - in anything he did . face it , he worked his ass off and he is a very smart man .
POS some interesting thoughts concerning christopher reeve 's superman
NEG unfortunately i feel this was her death sentence
NEG coming to bat for louisiana , theamazingkort . <br> <br> well , i have to agree that this is definitely a leap backwards for how the rest of the nation thinks of louisiana . but just like everywhere else , there are probably going to be more idiots than there are rational thinkers . included in those idiots just so happens to be our governor . it 's a sad state of affairs , but it 's a reality for us . i , and many others i know , do not and have not ever supported bobby jindal in his decisions to do anything and i for sure did n't vote for the guy . <br> <br> so i 'm asking nicely , please do n't pigeon hole all louisiana residents , some of us are smart enough to wipe our own asses .
NEG bush had been getting intelligence reports since he was elected - 11 months before 9/11 occurred . 9/11 happened during bush 's presidency plain and simple . he had plenty of time to do something . beyond that , just because clinton dropped the ball does n't actually excuse the fact bush was reading my pet goat during 9/11 , i call this kindergarten ethics . thank god you nut jobs were voted out - say hello to reality gop .
NEG - the bible is the word of god written by man . it is a true collection of stories written as lessons . you do n't have to take the actual words literally to be a believer . i am a christian but i do n't think that the heavens , earth and everything was created in 7 , literal , days . seven days could be tens or hundreds of thousands , or millions , of years . ` soon ' is given as the time when jesus will return and we all know that soon to us obviously is n't ` soon ' to god as it 's been a couple thousand years so far . as an engineer i am well aware of the mountains of evidence of evolution and fully believe it to be true as well . the two are not mutually exclusive . <br> <br> you will say that it awfully convenient that we ca n't prove god exists . but i tell you this ... it 's awfully convenient that something is either fully , literally , true or it is n't true at all . i think you need to think more fully , and critically , about the possibilities that exist rather than claiming something is n't true because there is no proof , without any proof of your own .
NEG better living through nihilism !
POS super mario bros showed us how platformers should play , super mario world showed us how beautiful a mario game could look , mario 64 came out and said ` woo ! 3d ! ' but galaxy is the first one that pretty much nailed all of it and still remained fun . i do n't think i have wanted to put the controller down at any time while playing galaxy . <br> <br> super mario galaxy is the best mario game . possibly one of the best of any game . <br> <br> except alex kidd in miracle world ...
NEG facebook , who cares . . sad muppets vying to be more popular than each other . stupid applications and even more ridiculous status updates . load of old bollocks ! <br> <br> burried for containing the word facebook !
POS well , he 's allowing someone else to present their case . in the interview he questions executive pay caps . he does actually argue the case of the executive . however , you do make a good point .
NEG and i think you are a slanderous and ignorant fool , mostly because rush does n't use drugs any longer . great how free speech works , is n't it ? i mean , where else can all the people who do n't know anything get to talk and then i can show up and show them how ignorant they are ? i love it !
NEG i 'm glad someone remembers that poor little boy torn from a nation of freedom and sent back to castro .
NEG what the fuck happened to the hippocratic oath ? any actual doctor doing that brings disgrace to the entire medical community .
NEG the human being created civilization not because of willingness but of a need to be assimilated into higher orders of structure and meaning . the individual desires judgment . without that desire , the cohesion of groups is impossible , and so is civilization . first , judgment came from the gods . then , it came from celebrity -LRB- the observation and judgment of others -RRB- . now we can implement the same functionality with data-mining algorithms - our next judge will probably be an omni-present self-aware system that we build ourselves , which eerily echos voltaire .
NEG i have to agree with the jackson thing , and if we agree that the effectiveness of an administration is the benchmark , then you may have to put george bush in the top 10 . <br> <br> you may not like his policy , but he damn sure got it done . <br>
POS was not even surprised read wii first EMO_HAPPY
POS hybrid f1 !!!
NEG damn for all that hype it was n't all that funny .
POS this is true , however the first one does function as a stand-alone movie . just like star wars ep . 4
NEG that 's why i run my card counter on a commodore 64 .
NEG 8 engines per car for the season . fia wants the teams to build more efficient engines/gearboxes that can last for more than one race .
NEG beat me to it .
NEG god damn patent wars .
NEG buried , as i did n't see any nuke go off . you can make any zombie dance to rick astley .
NEG umm , the corporate world is not like the consumer world . none of the servers we buy at american express ` come with windows server ' preinstalled , we must pay for a license for every server we install it on . <br> <br> what planet are you on ? <br> <br>
POS ca n't wait to see pics ... i 'm either getting a marq or borg as my next gun
NEG we have conclusive proof that that priest is harboring weapons of mass destruction . <br> <br> oh and it 's not ` alliance ' . it 's ` coalition of the willing ' now .
NEG wtf , this article and this comment thread is a perfect example of whatever the article writer is talking about , of which i have no idea . is this really a problem for anyone who is n't well entrenched in the gaming industry ? i have no idea what the writer is talking about as he cites no examples , and it amazes me that everyone on this thread is more or less agreeing also without providing any examples except for yahtzee . maybe i 'm just not ` in the know ' , even though i read at least 3-4 gaming sites daily ?
POS dugg for cute bear :d
NEG spoiler alert : you will die alone . <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> not directed at you , 007kz .
NEG i 'd like to take her for a test drive to check the tatt personally ...
NEG * loser . <br> i 'm leaving the ad hominem attack alone , but where are you conjuring this fear of ` they 'll take mah guns ' from ? any source ? or are you just like all the fat white sellers i saw at the last gun show i was at ?
NEG the us post office posted a $ 5.1 billion loss in 2008 . if the post office really needs people to run their company into the ground , my 5-year old could probably do a damn fine job of it , and he 'll only charge $ 400 -LRB- the cost of a lego death star -RRB- , not $ 800,000 .
NEG another statement from the writer of the blogpost : <br> <br> ` worse yet , the noise-makers on the blogs are attacking marcia for demanding justice in this case because they think she 's attacking muslims . ' <br>
NEG cv , books , patents , video , conferences , workshops , expedition , iumab , research <br>
NEG if this had michael phelps in the title , it would probably be number one right now .
POS yeah commenting about digg on digg is unrelated <br> gold star .
NEG the current beer tax in oregon , according to the story i saw on the news , said the current tax is less than one cent per pint . while i 'd say -LRB- as an oregonian and a beer drinker -RRB- this is too minimal , and i * would * support a tax increase -LRB- we have such a budget shortfall here they 're talking about closing all the public schools in april because we ca n't afford to keep 'em open -RRB- , an 1800 % jump is n't a reasonable amount in my book . <br> <br> it should be stated for the record that a barrel of beer equals two kegs , so a $ 50 tax per barrel works out to $ 25 per 15.5 gallon keg , or about 20 cents per pint at a bar . <br> <br> of course , area brewers here are claiming it 's going to raise the cost of a pint by $ 2 , which is ridiculous .
NEG sorry , not the case . this cop did everything he could to get phelps arrested , but in the end there just was not enough evidence . a picture of an empty bong , without showing pot in it , without showing phelps inhaling , and without an admission of smoking pot will go nowhere in court and the cop knows this . <br> <br> do n't give the guy any extra credit .
NEG 72 % of the 49 % of the 27 % when including the 18 % of the stereotype group of 19 % . . these studies do n't mean jack . <br> <br> first of all you 're ` surveying ' which means the information is already twisted by the people answering , second of all your group is insignificantly small compared to overall gaming audience which skews the results even further . <br> <br> with no indication of where the group was picked -LRB- as in what part of the fantastic little globe of ours -RRB- it skews the results even further - certain parts of the world seem to be in constant state of depression anyway , judging by the medical sales at least .
NEG i think prostitue is some kind of foreign word .
NEG he 's some friend to stick around and help a friend being robbed . i actually know some people that would back away and yell advice , or run . <br> <br> this one guy i know , he 's not my friend , but three other friends and i lured him into the woods and then one of the friends appeared out of nowhere and started ` raping ' our other friend . three to one , you 'd think the plan would be to take the ` rapist ' on , but no , this guy was scared shitting bricks and wanted to run . then again the fact he does n't respect women 's rights and stuff might have been a factor . still , i would n't depend on him to stand up to a five year old . i do n't think he ever went near the woods again .
NEG the rest is protectionist claptrap . it does not seem to occur to buchanan that jobs are lost and gained in a vibrant economy . prior to this depression , we lost a huge number of manufacturing jobs because of automation . according to dr. sowell , china lost the same percentage of manufacturing jobs that we did . <br> <br>
NEG it was the individual who believed the cat ` felt there was something wrong . ' and you 're debating on the cats ` knowledge ' ?! now , if you 're really paying attention you 'll put together a few things ; notice that it is mentioned the cancer was in an early stage , and could have gone undetected for five or more months . the cats behavior must have seemed random or spontaneous to the individual -LRB- hence his concern being triggered by an event which was n't normal -RRB- . you can very reasonably assume that cat may have sensed a * difference * in the owners ` state ' from one point in time to another . the cat does n't need to think there 's something ` wrong , ' i 'm sure if the cats senses were capable of detecting oder from the cancer then it was simply recognizing and curious about a change , nothing more . <br> <br> the question of ` good ' or ` bad ' is irrelevant , it 's people who determine that subjectively , well all animals eventually learn it hence being able to avoid danger . it could be just a coincidence , albeit an incredible one , the cats behavior was apparantly as ` recently odd ' as the cancer within this individuals lungs . <br> <br> it 's possible this is a coincidence , and evidence from research suggests it may not be . i 'm not going to make a decision either way , i 'll just appreciate the new information i 've been able to consume and learn more about it in time . <br> <br> the important question is ; ` could the cat have detected the cancer ? ' - where on the body the cat was scratching is the only place i see the greatest possibility for coincidence . the detection of the cancer itself may very well have been real and without the need for the cat to ` believe it was a bad thing . ' <br> <br> imho .
NEG the usps is an obsolete , useless organization . <br> 90 % of what they deliver is junk mail that clutters the house !
POS nice work if you can get it

NEG english fail !
NEG i hate mac users because they think they are better than everyone else . <br> apple 's next campaign : we are for the snobby people who have bigger credit balances . <br> <br> btw , being in college and majoring in digital media , i do n't drive tractors anymore . i should change my username . i have not done a project yet that pc alternative software could not do .
NEG no , no , no , no . nooooo

POS utorrent has a google filetype : torrent search box on their site EMO_HAPPY
NEG 1 - not a land grab ? what is it then ? a continuation of the statuesque ? <br> 2 - what if hamas claims they are targeting military targets ? therefore and civilian damage would just be collateral . just like israel claims . <br> 3 - democracy means you can vote for anyone you want . <br> 4 - perhaps they would negotiate if you took them off that stupid list and actually attempted to talk with them , you know like people ? <br> 5 - britain had a conscience
NEG does a picture of their face count as real information ?
NEG frost-bush in theaters soon <br> i 'm not a crook !
NEG rue is french for ` street '
NEG why did n't they put the engine and propeller in the back ? that thing would be a bit windy for the driver/passenger in that configuration .
NEG so i guess what happens in the barracks does n't stay in the barracks after all .
NEG that seems reasonable for such a unique domain name . maybe the government will purchase it off the guy to help bail out the porn industry .
NEG it 's time to stop playing the blame game . what bush has done might have been bad but i honestly believe in obama 's message of bipartisanship and understanding . everything we do should be for the state , and a case against bush would divide the country in twain -LRB- yes , i just wanted to say ` twain ' -RRB- . a case like that would make it difficult for any republicans -LRB- who answer to their constituency -RRB- to work on economic packages with democrats . <br> <br> i do n't think it 's fair to let bush off the hook , but right now his ` crimes ' are less important than saving our economy , soldiers , and rights .
NEG i have a nose-picker 's cold right now .
NEG and heavies with natascha !

NEG ` the u.s. is running out of rich people ' is actually one of the less stupid things she said here .
NEG on the more b-list end of this list , what about giovanni and marissa ribisi ? -LRB- i know we do n't like to count them since they 're apparently scientologists , but they 're not incredibly bad actors ... -RRB-

POS that was the best !
NEG oh come on !! <br> s and b keys are not even close on the keyboard for an honest typing mistake ...
POS you 're a door gorilla and you managed to write a -LRB- reasonably -RRB- coherent sentence ? i take my hat off to you , sir .
NEG it is actually climate change , you say that theres record cold temperatures across the globe , thought about australia lately ? its pretty messed up . down south in victoria we have bush fires . extreme bush fires , that have been burning for weeks . now this happens every year yes , but not this bad . and just the other week nsw was the hottest part of the earth . now up north of aus we have floods through north qld . . . yes again it does flood in north qld . . but this is intense . <br> now i think this ` geo engineering ' crap is bullshit , like we havent fucked around with the earth enough . why not get out and do some good , get solar and hydro and wind plants happening , yeah theyll cost , but we are actually running out of coal , and those emissions are doing terrible things . and people winge about the miners losing jobs ? well its not like they cant go and work in solar wind and hydro plants ... and now i hear people saying nuclear , yeah thats heaps clever , give usa and japan the power to have nuclear weapons . way clever . and the nuclear waste ? that wont have any effect on the environment . . not at all . <br> and yeah its all ` safe ' but one fuck up and you 've got deformities growing out of the ground , spreading through the ocean . whyve we got ta keep taking risks ? <br> people need to pull their heads out

NEG esstee , <br> <br> read the article . <br> he was n't attacked by his animal . <br> he was attacked by two other chimps at the facility . <br> his chimp was n't even wild ... it was domesticated . <br> <br> there is no moral to this story other than the perseverance of the human spirit .
NEG i went to an all you can eat chinese in leeds uk , they had a section for english people and a section for the chinese , that section had chickens feet and stuff .
NEG huge moral hazard . the more they give you , the bigger the problem will be , as it artificially influences the housing market and encourages bad spending for short term gains and huge long term losses , not only from the buyers , but those who own the properties or intend to invest , particularly in low income housing construction . it will lead to a housing stagflation .
NEG if you look up you 'll find a post of his .
NEG kinseyincanada : yeah so anyone with a cell phone should just throw it away and get the motofone f3 , is that right ?
NEG did anyone else think his voice was off this week ? he said he was sick in the end credits part , but i 'm wondering if it 's just me .
POS holy shit that 's big !!!!
NEG i guess that would encourage more walking and less driving . a similar concept was part of the platform of the freak power ticket that tried to take charge of aspen in the early 1970 's .
NEG i was generalizing , feel free to bury me if you want .
NEG i agree , it 's spam .
NEG shame about the chimp but i 'm a little more sad about the woman who lost her face .
NEG no just some boner that walks on water
POS for the record , those are fungi , not plants . <br> <br> granted , they are sexy fungi .
NEG i have deep concerns . as much as we need speed to fix the policies which authorized the many abuses of civil liberties the decisions need to be tempered with an aim to the future to prevent these abuses from happening again . having said that , the president has made some decisions which are clearly contrary to the goal of restoring all civil liberties , eliminating the poisonous policies and protecting us in the future . <br> <br> i intend to continue to read about his decisions and if they do not show a clear direction toward restoration of our civil liberties very soon i am likely to be marching in the streets with the ` radicals . ' <br> <br> and after reading the testimony of spc. brandon neely and realizing that we still have people who have been in those cages -LRB- see the picture in the following -RRB- for 6 or 7 years every day counts . <br> this is not just a national embarrassment it becomes a crime to which all of us are a party if we do not take steps to urge our elected officials to take action . and to open investigations and prosecutions .
NEG acorn-are you kidding me ? where do you get your news from ? rushycontin ? clownhall?faux news ? acorn gets no money-retard .
NEG the federal government has no legal right to own or restrict the use of land in sovereign states . that is one of the reasons washington d.c. was created .
NEG in general ?
NEG the 50 's and 60 's had the highest percentage of union jobs in american history . it was also when americans as a whole had the highest standard of living and the country was at the height of its prosperity . unions increase wages , which increase consumption , which stimulate production , which increases wealth . you do the math . the reaganomics idea that making people poor somehow benefits the economy ... well , we 've seen how that 's worked out , have n't we ?
NEG that was just a rumor at the time .
NEG i do n't know . maybe we should ask the internet companies why they ca n't keep up with demands for more bandwidth by upgrading our country 's infrastructure since , you know , the government pays them to do it .
NEG 6 = / = 5
NEG a 'd like to rule the world with an iron fist , please .
NEG <br> democrats also supported it ! <br> they are both to blame .
POS great initiative - spread the word ! <br> webdesigners of the world - unite !
NEG ` the assertion that some of the spending in the bill is n't stimulus ' <br> media matters thinks that anytime the government spends money on anything that stimulates the economy . in economics this is called the fallacy of the broken windows . the idea that if a store gets it 's windows broken and has to fix them this stimulates the economy . <br> <br> not true . the storeowner has to spend money , but if not for the broken window he could have spent that money on something else . <br> <br> does media matters believe the government should pay people to dig holes and then fill them in ? imagine how many people that would put to work ? of course , that 's silly . but in the same way , we believe , and fox news explains , that spending on useless projects is not stimulative . <br> <br> government spending projects did n't work in the 30s . did n't work in japan in the 90s . never worked in the now-defunct soviet union . it 's really never worked . and it 's crazy to gamble everything we have on the chance that the very first time in history that it will work would be now .
NEG libs ... always emotional , always race baiting . . an idiot is someone who voted for and signed a bill that nobody even read . . the dems love to bypass the normal procedures to push their liberal agendas by back handed tactics like this or putting activist justices on the bench . they hate to have things -LRB- like the things written into this pork/stimulus bill -RRB- actually go through the proper legislative process so we all would see what is being proposed and debated then voted on . . <br> <br> they insult the constitution and every american ... even if they had to find new people to write the bill , it would be the same bs by the same extreme radical leftost partisan democrats . . too bad . i left the party because of the leftist/marxists who are in charge now ... they all are embarrassments to the party and the country . . sharpton is one of the biggest embarrassment . the american people made a big mistake on election day and maybe now they will be finding out the truth and buyers remorse will set in . .
NEG this is insane . that makes their reviews useless . man , i used to like yelp .
NEG gfe
NEG no it is blind irrational religious hatred . <br> <br> alot of ethnic groups have been kicked around and denied their piece of the pie , but you do n't see cyprots generally in the streets yelling ` death to the turk ' or tibetans ` death to the chinese ' calls .
NEG obviously they do n't know russian and they are trying to make something funny .
NEG at the bottom of the page is an ad for stainless steel water bottles
NEG if only all the ph.d. economists had bothered to check with you before moving forward , everything would be ok . it 's such a shame that you 're on the internet , typing in all caps , instead of at the upper echelons of government , saving the world .
NEG ` when it was movie industry lawyer monique wadsted 's turn , she wasted no time in unexpectedly introducing new evidence . both the defense and the court complained at this point , with wadsted choosing to shout down the judge . ' <br> <br> i love that the industry ca n't seem to lose this trial fast enough . it 's almost like they think that if this goes badly , they 'll get another shot or just move onto the next high profile case . somebody needs to clue these assholes in that this is the superbowl . there is no other game after this . lose this case , and the coffin is nailed shut for good . <br> the whole thing os a joke , i mean tpb 's front page as of yesterday was , ' i iz kingkong ! i can haz torrentz ? ' the sheer amount of ownage this week has been epic !

POS i 'd rather drive traffic to this most excellent of blogs . <br> <br> read it at home .
NEG <br> <br> whoooooooooooosh
NEG sounds like someone has a little sand in thier vagina ?
NEG so the enviro whacks and politically correct wannabes in government think that someone is going to sell off a perfectly good vehicle that they own and has payments of $ 0.00 / month so they can go into debt to the tune of $ 20,000 - $ 40000 just to ` save ' on fuel costs and taxes ? once again -LRB- as usual -RRB- the sqeaking wheels are living in their own version of reality . <br> gas isnt going to stay cheap forever . offer the vehicles that get better mileage at a reasonable price , not the price of a split-level home . if need be , subsidise them to keep the $ $ within reason . apply tax cuts to encourage purchases . its amazing how things can happen automatically with honey rather than vinegar . <br> <br>
NEG we 're going to have the 2 party system for many years to come , not much you or i can do about it . <br> <br> i got more money from bush 's tax cuts + stimulus than i will from obama 's $ 13 a week - and i 'm middle class . so i 'll take the republicans over the democrats , financially speaking .
NEG read the article idiot
NEG it 's a compromise . it minimizes the loss , does n't negate it . if the plan was to compensate mortgage companies to for the full amount that they would have made off of the shady loan , we 'd have to set up a few more printing presses to print all the money needed . <br> <br> from my understanding there are many banks & mortgage lenders who would like to renegotiate the terms but are not being allowed to by the holding company that backs up the loan . this program allows the bank or mortgage company to turn the loan completely over to fannie mae & freddie mac for the cost of $ 1,000 . the holding company is the big loser here , but they are the ones who established the rules that got is in this trouble in the first place .
NEG kerrigore is a liar .
POS and i thought my job was bad ! thanks for the refreshing info EMO_HAPPY
NEG deadpan stare .
NEG um , yeah ... were talking about the man behind the mormon gulag : <br>
NEG so does this mean , since i 'm a victim of drunk driving , and my legs are getting worse and worse by the day -LRB- the idiots got a slap on the hand -RRB- , that i can sue the fucking beer companies , for knowingly providing a substance that can kill/injure others ?
NEG some thought that blue ray was going to save the day cause it was better quality -LRB- audio and picture -RRB- but truth is that consumers really do n't care or know about quality but rather prefer convenience . take a look at the music industry . audio cd 's are much better quality than streaming or down loadable -LRB- mp3 files -RRB- still consumers are downloading or ripping songs from itunes and other online sites sacrificing audio quality for portability and on-demand needs . hollywood is not dead . the maker of electronic equipment are . what the people are asking for are tvs with direct online connection and great software interface to download , stream , play , watch , hear and browse anytime any media .
NEG what ? there is absolutely no effort underway anywhere to keep the lower classes from breeding . have you been to a walmart lately ?
NEG google holder 's involvement in the cover-up of the oklahoma city bombing and the related murder of kenneth trentadue . holder is an avowed gun grabber who has publicly stated he believes citizens have no right to own firearms . he is the very picture of a monster .

NEG matthew stafford is a poor man 's jamarcus russell . the lions will be terrible if they pick him 1 . take curry or monroe and try to work it out with stanton or culpepper .
NEG i am white and i do n't see attacks on white people . i see our society appropriately attacking racism where and when it exists . <br> <br> ` the democrat party on the other hand , talks down accomplishment , penalizes success and frowns upon independence . just look at the new administration and what is coming out of their mouths . ' <br> <br> oh , you mean a black man raised by a single mother and his grandparents who earned his way through school with hard work , excellent grades , working to help poor people while attending school . achieving more than anyone could have ever expected from a man born without family connections ? yeah , that 's not accomplishment .
NEG actually . . no . ot a valid defense . that is why major sites have lawyers . or you do n't sign .
NEG do n't assume that because you 're publishing the mayor 's email address that he 's going to get all praise . here 's my letter ... <br> <br> you 're getting a lot of publicity for your fox interview about not being ashamed to have great healthcare . but americans are increasingly aware that if you get healthcare at the expense of families like mine with no healthcare , you should be ashamed of yourself . if companies can provide great healthcare to their employees without going under , great . but if they have to get government involved , it becomes just plain theft through taxes , inflation and debt . <br> <br> sincerely , <br> <br> a concerned small business owner
NEG or you could just use the closest intersection , like bethel and king st , 96813 .
NEG it amazes me that content like this is locked to everyone but us users . <br> <br> when you make it this hard to access content legally , no wonder people resort to bittorent and bypass all this localization crap .
NEG oh geeze people -- i ca n't stand the psuedo-half science these hot air fantatics post . they mix cherry-picked datum with ad-hominem attacks to try to anger their opponents off of the debate . <br> <br> you and yours are pathetic , bombula . you know you do n't have any actual fact on your side and so you jump straight to the mud-slinging . please look up ` radiative forcing ' on someplace with a bit of actual credibility beyond wikipedia for posting -- you clearly have no idea how the phenomena works at all .
NEG not really stupid list
NEG again - you do n't quite understand how clinical depression works . <br> it 's not that he was unhappy that his pills were taken from him and decided to kill himself , no . his medication was helping to correct a chemical imbalance in his brain that was causing suicidal thoughts . <br> <br> you could say that because he was at a chemical imbalance that he was n't capable of making decisions ; that he was n't himself . if he were functioning normally -LRB- ie on his meds -RRB- then he would not have made this choice . he made an impared decision - and unlike alcohol he did not choose to be impared . <br> <br> so there . it is tragic that he is dead .
NEG fuck geoblocking !!!!!!!!!!!! <br> <br> edit : also ... riaa/mpaa and all the other proponents of stupid copyright and licencing bullshit on the internets !
NEG > only the market can provide a quality product at a lower price because it is run by people who are in search of a profit <br> <br> actually no . what actually happens is that people who are in search of a profit realise they are better of spending money on advertising , rather than improving the product . <br> <br> ` u.s. pharmaceutical industry spent 24.4 % of the sales dollar on promotion , versus 13.4 % for research and development '
NEG read more stories at check out on how to do it !
POS then in that case this looks like a good improvement ! especially as that hardware will go a lot further on osx than on windows , so it 's a nice little box .

NEG rick was ok with rewarding all those morons standing around him with government money via the wall street bailout , was n't he ?
NEG all religions seem to be composed of a vast majority that just tries to get through life following a belief structure they find comforting , and of course all religions get knocked by everyone else because a somewhat statistically insignificant portion of their congregation are absolute douche bags who never seem to be more than 8 ' away from a camcorder .
POS that is fucking awesome .
NEG newcastle , uk

NEG so we now have a debate ... who is taking the bets !!!
NEG no wonder we are all so stressed out . information overload .
POS tubatechno : <br> <br> your conclusion is correct , no one in society has any moral authority . therefor no one should be given any opportunity to impose their morality on anyone else , and we should stick to democratic methods of making consensus rules based on morals shared by a plurality . <br> <br> so yes , we absolutely need to go down that road , and continue to follow it .
NEG you 're still trying to categorically lump in-vitro fertilization together with more noble pursuits such as fertility medications . <br> <br> i 'm talking specifically about in-vitro fertilization , not the more benign treatments like fertility drugs . <br> <br> you 're also making an emotional appeal in trying to draw a parallel between the physically disabled , and those who are deliberately determined to procreate at any cost . <br> <br> really , ld , i expected better than that of you .

NEG in case the squirrel comes in ? i 'd have a hard time trying to get the squirrel out , those lil buggers are devious .
NEG from the catechism of the catholic church section ii paragraph 2358 : <br> <br> ` the number of men and women who have deep-seated homosexual tendencies is not negligible . this inclination , which is objectively disordered , constitutes for most of them a trial . they must be accepted with respect , compassion , and sensitivity . every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided . these persons are called to fulfill god 's will in their lives and , if they are christians , to unite to the sacrifice of the lord 's cross the difficulties they may encounter from their condition . ' <br> <br> you are fully within your rights to disagree with the premise that homosexuality is ` objectively disordered ' -LRB- make sure you know what that means first though -RRB- , but you can not say that the church calls for torture or anything approaching that .
POS right on , docbob . it 's cool to see an obama supporter honest enough to admit they 're scratching their head right now , just as i will be more than glad to admit it if i 'm proven wrong about the guy . i honestly would love to vote democrat for my very first time in 2012 , because it will mean we had a good four years . <br> <br> but here i am , i 'm getting my taxes together and i 'm getting squeezed , i do n't even know how i 'm going to get the money together to pay what i owe because it 's been a tough year and all i can keep thinking of is , we have a tax cheat at the head of the irs . what the hell ??? <br> <br> is this change we can believe in ?
NEG @ musphaq - oh my god
NEG what ? i 'm being buried ? <br> <br> you people probably think the natives got smallpox because they had wussy immune systems , not because a foreign microorganism was introduced that they 've never been exposed to before and therefore had no immunity to . <br> <br> did you kids not get taught how vaccines work ?
NEG fucking horrible , that psycho deserves more then just acid in the eye 's .
NEG fuck kanye
NEG we figured out the auto-bury exists long ago after nothing from socialblade.com would ever hit the front page , several times the domain was submitted to digg and got over 300 diggs and never hit the front page .
NEG the only problem will be the accumulation of roaches . if you 've ever seen roaches that congregate in free standing coffee vending machines , you 'll know what i 'm talking about . on the other hand , that might mean additional protein . i 'm torn .

NEG did you look into filing charges against the doctor ? if he is n't doing his job , i do n't think he deserves to be licensed .
NEG i really want you to grasp what i 'm trying to say here . i say you ` leach ' off of our healthcare because we 're the only group of people providing the constant breakthroughs in medical technology and treatments . if it were n't for our free market system advancing the system in leaps and bounds , we 'd all be using leaches to cure cancer still . i say you leach off of us because although you obviously have to buy the technology , that does n't help create anything new so you in fact contribute nothing to the system . and if you wo n't accept the widely known fact that the healthcare and quality of treatment for serious diseases is so much more superior in the usa than there 's no point in arguing any further . <br> <br> i said give me examples of government run programs that are n't bested by private sector counterparts . there are n't any . every single example of government run programs that actually have an equivalent private sector alternative always comes in behind that alternative . look at ups and fedex compared to the usps for example .
NEG firearm and ammunition manufacturers in the us are working major overtime to keep up with demand .

NEG just what the world needs , another nuclear arms race . thing is , what seems to be complicating matters is that so many countries can claim they are merely developing alternative energy sources because of the dwindling fossil fuel supply . but nuclear is so expensive , and potentially very dangerous -LRB- remember chernobyl and three mile island ? -RRB- . because of the efforts made by big oil over the past 30 years , solar power has never been seriously considered although it certainly deserves to be , along with wind technology . <br> <br> the most worrisome factor in this whole mess is the fear that is being deliberately spread by the media and by the government . we have to stop this war machine , and not just drink the noxious kool-aid being served up on this issue .
POS hahahahaha lol !
NEG @ darkshroud re : ' . . add in a low resource usage av like nod32 ' <br> <br> and that is why you fail . how about installing an os that does n't need an anti-virus product to work properly ?

POS ooh ! shiny ! EMO_HAPPY
NEG actually , people will buy a car from a company in bankruptcy protection if the government or 3rd party issues a guarantee . people will not buy a car from a company that has a very high probability of filing for bankruptcy the next month . because then their warranty is at risk of being wiped by the bankruptcy filing . i 'd rather have the government spend money issuing a guarantee on the cars and then chapter 11 . it is a lot cheaper than fueling all the existing legacy costs .

NEG the i stands of its a ds idiot , same thing we 've been selling for years , but now with a sh * tty camera . enjoy wasting your money again .
NEG i did , thank god america did n't choose a racist greedy old neo-confederate .
NEG i doubt there will be another strike . the basis for the original strike was a provision in writer 's contracts for royalties gained by digital distribution , including dvd sales percentages -LRB- which they found to be too low and were an antiquated measurement based on antiquated production costs of vhs tapes -RRB- as well as internet streaming and other distribution channels . <br> <br> writers were the main cause of the strike since a great deal of their money seems to come from royalties . larry david addressed this briefly in a curb your enthusiasm episode where someone asks him about seinfeld . <br> writers_guild_of for more information .
NEG this was on an episode of ` all in the family ' where archie complains to mike that he put the toilet paper on backwards . so now in some weird subconscious way every time i wipe my butt i think of archie bunker .

NEG this is stupid as shit . who cares that someone can play a song on a virtual keyboard , not to mention , probably the most basic shit out there next to marry had a little lamb . if he busted out some mozart or beethoven i 'd give him props , but this is nothing impressive . buried .
NEG snakes are not like dogs . as long as they keep the snake fed , all should be right . however , the first time that snake is hungry and the parents are out running errands . oh boy . in the belly of a snake , that is .
NEG going to the original composite photo , i think it would have worked better if they had made a 2d array of the undistorted photos rather than squeezing them horizontally for the article . the images , or at least some of them , would have still looked ` vase-like ' .
NEG <br> <br> market adjustments to home prices is fine and works for just about every commodity out there . complete crashing , like what we 've seen in detroit , is not a good thing and i do n't mind the government working to make that not happen . i know two people who foolishly got adjustable rate mortgages and now ca n't afford them at their higher rates . numbers would obviously have to be run , but to me it makes more sense to readjust these people 's mortgages to fixed rate than to have people , who could pay a lower fixed rate , default on their loans . for those who simply bit off more than they could chew -LRB- e.g. making $ 50k a year , yet got a $ 500k loan -RRB- , let them sink or swim on their own .
NEG fl is stupid , why the fuck do we live here !!!???
POS only a billion ? why do i feel that 's a low estimate ? subsidies for growing farms aside , i still think it would easily surpass $ 1 billion . even so , this is great news , and am glad that california can take this step in bringing attention to one simple fact : marijuana is virtually harmless .
POS and yet another reason to use foxit reader .
NEG sweet beard
NEG i think you mention for people to get ready for katrina squared -LRB- that 's katrina ^ 2 or ` katrina times katrina ' -RRB- . but i say it might be katrina plex -LRB- that 's katrina ^ katrina or ` katrina times katrina katrina times ' -RRB- .
NEG reality comes crashing home sooner than you think . in 2 months this will have a new story - for now , still laid off , and desperately need work 10 levels below my last paygrade , please please please get me a job with mcdonalds etc. <br> <br> that story however wo n't make news .

NEG ridiculous review ! while reviewer acknowledges the worst parts -LRB- namely kids being blinded and maimed and then forced to beg -RRB- it then connects the movie to some obscure social issue of the moment in indian society . i know that street kid can not win a millionaire game show , just like i know that forest gump can not be a successful athlete , businessman and a war hero . it 's just a movie for god 's sake
NEG unfortunately the ego of us indians is bigger than our desire to fix our s @ t. this hoopla by some indians is because they do n't want their dirty laundry displayed in public . i 've driven through these slums in mumbai and i can assure you they are incredibly miserable enough to make a grown man cry . there is nothing desirable , artsy , cultural , or eclectic about them . <br> <br> / indian
POS haha nice
NEG if the news industry receives a bailout and is beholden to the government , then it is n't a news anymore . the power of the purse concept it exactly why the founding fathers did not allow government to tax newspapers . if they can not adapt , they have to die . i do n't want them too , but this country has to stop practicing reverse darwinism -- the practice of sparing the weak by killing the strong .
NEG you 're giving away my rib recipe !
NEG now is the best time to get this bill through ... cali struggling with the $ $ $
NEG i think the address range of ipv4 is the least of our problems . that can be solved by moving to ipv6 . <br> the bigger problem is going to be domain name lookup -LRB- dns -RRB- and having a human readable name for all those addresses . already the word-like combinations for domains are pretty much exhausted and strange words appear -LRB- eg . digg.com -RRB- . <br> assume every device has a unique ipv6 address on the internet . how are you going to remember the address of your home computer for example . it will be something like 2df8 :3 ebc :7 c6a : b82c :6 eb3 :276 d :75 a4 :3 d2c when most people are lucky to remember their home phone number . mypc.streetaddress.mytown.com would be memorable and unique , but who wants to give away that information on the net . <br> dns is global , so lookups based on ` unique ' factors like your name wo n't work . there 's most likely a thousand other who shares the same name as you . the internet is going to need a better directory service ! <br> <br>
NEG i believe i discovered this after failing a midterm due to facebook distraction last year .

NEG honestly the colts do n't need him . manning can probably throw the ball to anyone . besides gonzalez and wayne , do n't forget the colts have dallas clark , who caught some ridiculous passes in traffic this season . <br> <br> what the colts really need is to sign an every-down running back , addai/rhodes just has n't been cutting it this season and if they can establish their running game , manning and his receivers would have a much easier time moving down the field with their passing game ; easier than having another solid receiver ironically .
NEG vegas sucks . all the strippers have kids and are on meth . jobs dont pay shit . its hot as hell . nothing to do except gamble , catch stds from the strippers who live next door or go boating on lake mead which is about to dry up . <br> <br> seriously , i moved to vegas a few years back because of the lower cost of living . i moved in december and had to move back to los angeles by june . think about that , vegas was so crazy , the people so fucked up that i had to move to los angeles to be around normal people again ! <br> <br> vegas is nothing but a pipe dream . she will always leave you broke and wanting to go back to where you came from .

NEG the dollar is not in the equation . i realize that dollars/pounds/yen are just pieces of paper whose values can be bubbles or -LRB- like the american dollar probably soon will -RRB- rapidly devalue . <br> <br> gold/silver are like currency in many ways though . they do have the advantage that , since it is difficult to print gold the market is n't likely to get flooded with gold - but many minerals and stones share this characteristic.what makes gold so special ? it 's all in our heads - just like every other bubble . <br> <br> land is even more difficult to print than gold . it grows more scarce with increases in population . houses often come with land and represent a significant amount of labor . if one owns a home with a value of ` x ' they will enjoy far more benifits than a person who owns a sum of gold with an equal value . the housing bubble was dumb but not as dumb as the gold bubble . <br> <br> i 'm not saying buying gold is necessarily stupid - you can get very rich off of bubbles as many did with housing - just be aware that they pop . <br> <br> also wealth is destroyed . depreciation , vandalism , consumption -LRB- eg . food -RRB- , and reduction in number of services provided all destroy wealth . i believe what you are getting at is that wealth does n't instantly evaporate unless icbms are launched . it is important to be aware that these factors do erase wealth because as a recession or depression wears on they will force some gold owners to cash in their investment to replace other assets . this will cause gold to start consistently losing value . this will cause a loss of confidence in the bubble - then it will pop .
NEG burried : inaccurate
NEG that is simply impossible mweather . <br> sorry to tell you this , but that shit you so love to buy will disappear after legalization ... you will be stuck buying the high quality weed , cheaper than the high quality costs now . oh what a shame . =p <br> <br> good luck finding any dealers willing to compete with legal business by selling shit . <br> just grow your own if you do n't like the tax . you do have that option .

NEG it sounds like in ms krause 's case they wo n't make any money . maybe they thought it would be a big bust and worth the money . i dunno . <br> <br> in a drug bust , the property of the one busted , or unclaimed property found at the site , or even the land itself , can be forfeit . it depends on a million things , but the basics are if there 's a criminal conviction in drugs , then it opens up the money game . this may only be with felonies , which may go toward ms. krause 's words about the sheriff expecting 500 plants instead of her 24 . <br> <br> anyway , assuming many things : <br> * bust somebody and later there 's a conviction <br> * the county then sues the -LRB- new -RRB- felon in civil court using the criminal conviction as evidence <br> * based on that evidence , the county gets the land , the car found there , etc. <br> <br> it 's very big money . while drug cases have special provisions to make it easier for the government to get the goods , it can also apply to other crimes . such as if somebody robs a bank , the county can sue to get the car that was used in the crime . otherwise , the car would -LRB- should -RRB- be returned after the case is over , even if the person is convicted . <br> <br> for drug cases , many times law enforcement is able to find a boatload of cash . not for ms krause 's 24 plants , but if they find a briefcase full of money , the county sues , gets the cash , and then they buy more ambulances , firetrucks , police cars , oak desks for the city counsel , etc. <br>
NEG douche .
NEG yes , it 's even funnier when you completely misinterpret it . do you honestly think what you said is the truth ? the content is copywritten , not the format the content is stored in . <br> <br> if i own the copyright to ` x ' which by default comes in format ` a ' and you take ` x ' and distribute in formats ` b ' , ` c ' and 'd ' i still own the copyright . <br> <br> your misguided interpretation would essentially mean all copyright law can be removed simply by continually changing the packaging , which it can not . <br> <br> whats really funny is the two other idiots who dugg you up thinking you know what your talking about . <br> <br> / / ianal , bidgtls

NEG this is irresponsible . people suffer from serious psychological illnesses and you 're telling them to take some bullshit herbs ? when this does n't work and they kill themselves i 'm sure the author will feel great about themselves . i 'm sure it 's fun to be apart of the whole new age movement , but ignoring real problems so that you can avoid those evil pills and that evil therapy for people who have real mental conditions so that you 're nonconformist is wrong . <br> <br> there 's a difference between feeling blue and unipolar depression .
NEG i 'll believe it when i see it . <br> <br> and no fair if you move them to another country , or change the name of the country , or any other bull .
NEG sorry i do n't fall into digg 's ` weed is the number one cureall ! ' . <br> <br> i 'm all for the legalization of weed , and perhaps passing it off as a medicine is a good way to make it more acceptable for the mainstream , but really now , do you think it 's a good idea to give cannabis to patients who could easily become depressed , depersonalized , or psychotic just to prove a point ? why do this when we already have many drugs that work great in conjunction with therapy ?
NEG how do they go the other way ? cant zipline uphill . <br> <br> unless youre on some pure colombiano whiteness
NEG slumdog millionaire soundtrack is the most bought out album of 2009 with no competition . they all sound like same romance and rich .

NEG radio this morning was saying that the ` oh god ' was coming from chris matthews .
NEG why would you want to compile a program on a phone ? the developer cross-compiles it on his computer and distributes a binary . since it will be an uniform software platform , there will be no need to compile locally in any way . this has worked for ages on ce devices such as the gp2x , nokia 770/n800/n810 , pandora , android , limo phones , etc. <br> <br> just because you can compile if you want does n't mean you have to . case in point : you can compile firefox on your windows pc . how many people actually do that ?
NEG that 's already pretty clear . if you 're a membership of the gop leadership , then what 's important is promoting the ` right ' ideology , not trying to keep americans from starving to death .
NEG ahh but their argument is that it did n't . <br> <br> you should have went out and bought all their overpriced commercial bullshit too . why do n't you own the dvd , the posters , the special features , the toys , the socks , the soundtrack ? <br> <br> they just need to accept that nobody wants that crap anymore . they are pitching a product nobodies interested in , that 's why they are losing money .

NEG it 's a well known fact you ca n't take pictures of many government buildings , in many countries including the united states . and second , as previously stated , the federal reserve is a private corporation . but things get tricky with its involvement with the government . so let me explain , in particular with the federal reserve police : <br> <br> federal reserve police are federal law enforcement officers to protect and safeguard the premises , grounds , property , personnel , including members of the board , of the board , or any federal reserve bank , and operations conducted by or on behalf of the board or a reserve bank . <br> <br> so yes , federal reserve police are federal officers and have the rights as such . do n't believe me ? check out united states code title 12 chapter 3 part ii section 248 -LRB- q -RRB-

NEG well-that was two days ago , now obama is at about 80 % . do n't think bush made it there until 9-11 . do n't forget last night on the monitor obama actually was scoring better with republicans than the democrats . so dream on-chicky 's .

NEG see fungie5 's response for some of the reason they do n't do this . basically the shuttle parachute works because it only has to safely slow the plane from a pretty slow speed that is just above the minimum speed the shuttle can ` fly ' at . it only has to work in one orientation to the horizon -LRB- horizontal nose forward -RRB- . and the shuttle frame is built like a mac truck compared to an airplane that is built like a bird . there is only one place the frame of an airplane could possibly withstand the forces generated by a parachute deployment , and that is at the root of the wings on the spar . not an ideal placement for a parachute .

NEG no problem with hearing it :d <br> 16 years old
NEG it 's one thing to copy minor or common features not available for macintosh browsers . i 'm fine with that . <br> <br> the problem is when apple rips off a feature and pretends they are the ones who thought of it in the first place . on the feature list , they claim they are the first browser to pass acid3 compliance . no , they are using the webkit engine which passed on the same day that opera 's engine passed as well . they say they are the first browser able to integrate with rss feeds . actually , opera and firefox both have been utilizing rss technology long before safari implemented that feature . <br> <br> those are only several examples of their hubris but there 's about a dozen more of these white lies spread throughout their marketing . i 'm ok with feature copying as a form of flattery , but apple has a bad habit of misrepresenting the facts to make it look like they were the innnovators when in actuality they are just pissing on the shoulders of giants .
NEG sorry about the pic , the editor didnt find an iranian facebook user over afp and then choose one from jakarta ! <br> so you may know iranain females -LRB- who most of the hate obligatory hijab -RRB- dont wear such ugly , black hijab in public !

NEG see ? you just added ` decent story ' into the mix . that , imo , is critical for a game to get a high score . great graphics can only take things so far . after a while you get tired of watching the same actions happening over and over again . the story is what keeps you coming back to finish the game .
NEG good idea , yes , but how would you stop people from coming and not paying in the long run , without affecting your budget ? maybe 5-10 % will overpay - the rest will underpay . i wish them luck anyway .

POS i swear , and ` award winning architechts '
NEG this sheik is from the middle-east , no ? oil is the largest export from that area , but oil is threatened by alternative fuels . i think this sheik is condemning the use of ethanol in order to keep demand for oil , his nation 's source of wealth , strong . his statement about alcohol is an excuse .
NEG ask david vitter .
NEG how could anyone bury a name like ` mrcoolerthanyou ' ?
NEG what part does n't make sense ? i do have some microbiology classes under my belt do you ? <br> <br> bacteria of all sorts are not good for you in certain doses . good bacteria can run a muck and cause disease too . we call them good bacteria because they are naturally part of the fauna of our bodies and in normal numbers they contributes to our health . when their numbers are too great they cause disease . whole milk spoils as well . <br> <br> outside of the environment they are acclimatized to -LRB- adapted to -RRB- the bovine body those bacteria will likely not do as well giving room for other bacteria to grow . many bacteria will be introduced at all levels of industrial handling and if those bacteria grow faster than the natural bovine fauna then you get dangerous whole milk . part of the reason why pasteurization was mandated int he first place was the rampant cases of food poisoning due to bacteria introduced into the milk and which did better than the ones already in the milk . <br> <br> think of yeast infections . yeast is a natural part of the fauna of human female genitalia but when there is a sudden shift in numbers or a ph shift which kills the yeast you can get an infection of either an over abundance of natural yeast or different strains of yeast . <br> <br>
NEG fine , then stay away from us .
NEG sorry fag , people not getting shot up takes precedent over your robocop fantasy target practice . additionally , you 're a prick if you are using anything more than a single shot to take down an animal .

NEG cell sites do n't link together across the country or world . some data will be transferred through a satellite if needed , they 'll just try to to route the data the most efficient way possible .

NEG maybe he has a girlfriend ?
POS i like it .
NEG it 's sad to think a bad economy may finally legalize a resource that can save us in so many industries . there have been several recent documentaries that have law enforcement officials admitting they are losing ` the war on weed ' even billions continued to be spent on this failed effort . maybe we should stop looking down on a natural herb that goes from mother nature and start looking up to how legalization can help the hungry , sick and homeless - not to mention our overall economic situation . a sustainable america is possible if the federal government would allow it . come on president obama , do whats right for america , this is one law we ca n't afford to keep on the books . have a grateful day and organic life . angie . com
NEG ` as fun as it could be i do n't really have the heart to point out all the holes in this . ' <br> <br> mmm ... better get the mythbusters on to this .

NEG i had the same experience , i also declined a second round . yeah it came back after a few months when it was done , less severe but it 's still there . i hear so many happily ever after stories about accutane that i sometimes wonder if i 'm the only one where it was effective for a short amount of time . <br> <br> i 'll never use that stuff again in my life , i 've never felt so tired , so weird , so messed up and so sore all over my whole life .
POS for top of the line mp4 support you can check <br> of course x264 and xvid stuff media filters must exist too .

NEG yeah , ivenoml 's comment went a bit far ... sjbdallas ' kinda ... ` fits ' : p
NEG it really is hypocrisy . the republican party , the party of large deficits , bitching & whining about spending . maybe the amount of stimulus spending is to excessive but the republicans are n't the ones to be putting down the hammer . it just looks dumb . i hate saying this but the democrats ' do nothingness ' the last eight years plus giving bush enough rope to hang himself has given them firm control . maybe the republicans can learn from that . stop bitching about things you had no problem with two months ago !!!!! this is your penance for not standing up to the last president who is guilty of everything you supposedly oppose .
NEG the thing you have left out of your analysis is the criminal behavior being engaged in by hedge funds . they have worked in cahoots with the analyst firms and even financial journalists to destroy public companies for gain . since the removal of the uptick rule in 2007 , short sellers have run rampant in the market . they took down a perfectly healthy bear stearns in a couple of days , for example , which would have been impossible with the uptick rule in place . you may think this is a conspiracy article , but it was written by a former treasury secretary : <br> <br> personally i 'm getting out of the stock market completely until they reinstate this rule .
NEG is this a trailer for the next fast and furious movie ? <br> <br> ps . i also feel like im watchin the intro from bobby 's world

NEG amen to that , chode . the new location downtown is pretty nice , too . though i find myself going to the egg & i in foshey , as well . <br> <br> did you see al 's breakfast in dinkytown was on the list , too ? i did n't see the mention of having to wait in line forever because the place only seats 10 people . .
NEG i 'm seriously thinking about starting a collection and file a class action against the members in congress , or somebody challenging the constitutionality of the fed reserve . i figure with the amount of time and the right publicity and get people educated on the facts we can really change it .
NEG but its got ta be a jewel encrusted pink collar .
POS ` congress needs to craft innovative legislation that makes health care more affordable without raising taxes or increasing the deficit . it also needs to repeal bad laws that keep health care costs higher than necessary . ' ` we should remember that hmos did not arise because of free-market demand , but rather because of government mandates . the hmo act of 1973 requires all but the smallest employers to offer their employees hmo coverage , and the tax code allows businesses -- but not individuals -- to deduct the cost of health insurance premiums . the result is the illogical coupling of employment and health insurance , which often leaves the unemployed without needed catastrophic coverage . ' ` while many in congress are happy to criticize hmos today , the public never hears how the present system was imposed upon the american people by federal law . as usual , government intervention in the private market failed to deliver the promised benefits and caused unintended consequences , but congress never blames itself for the problems created by bad laws . instead , we are told more government -- in the form of `` universal coverage '' -- is the answer . but government already is involved in roughly two-thirds of all health care spending , through medicare , medicaid , and other programs . ' ` the following are bills congress should pass to reduce health care costs and leave more money in the pockets of families : '
NEG although it seems morally wrong to cite an injured person of am accident , both parties are at fault . <br> <br> it 's not fair to blame the police , especially since most police departments require citations be written for injury accidents . <br> <br> besides , it 's not like the court wo n't drop those charges against him
NEG hmm , dunno how this got submitted when i dugg the original story ...
POS lots of help on this site
NEG fta : ' a 15-year-old schoolgirl in northeast england earned about √Ç # 14,000 -LRB- $ a30 ,641 -RRB- over two months by working as a prostitute . ... police officers who searched her home found more than # 8000 stashed in the attic in november last year . the girl , who can not be named because she is a minor , is thought to have netted around # 1700 pounds every weekend . ' <br> <br> this confirms my theory that pedobears are the rulers of the world and can pay any sum of money to satisfy their twisted sexual desires .
NEG science once again ignored by the mainstream so they can continue to collect dollars with marketing of the green business agenda .
NEG yeah but christianity is the only way evidently EMO_HAPPY * sarcasm *

NEG what a load of crap .
POS ooooooohhhhhhh ... ... snap .
NEG an easy solution for this is to lower your existing prices that your cellular customers pay . in turn , you induce loyalty and have a much happier and much larger customer base to keep in a broken economy . the cell phone companies have had consumers by the pair for years with the price point your paying compared to what it really costs them on the bottom line . <br> <br> it is true they have dumped some of the money back into better carrying technology and other notable positives , yet a price reduction should be on the foreground if they want to stay competitive and keep profit shares up in a longterm bubble .
NEG no 1929 was due -LRB- in part -RRB- to protectionism in america -LRB- is the ` buy american ' clause still in the bailout ?? -RRB- . but given a choice between being governed by corporations or being governed by a swollen interventionist state i choose the former
NEG nah , then you 'd find the used ones in vending machines as long as they were used by schoolgirls . <br> / s <br>
NEG i love how people are getting buried for saying its unimpressive . it really is easy . i 've done it and i do n't play soccer . it would be impressive if it was a farther range but he shot it from not even 3 point range . go ahead bury me but i know that a week from now you 'll try it yourself and you 'll find out its easy .
NEG i thought that i read somewhere before that micheal jackson owns the rights to a bunch of their music . anyone seem to remember this or did i just make this up ?
