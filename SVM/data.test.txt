NEG suicide rates among us soldiers are heading for a record high.eighty-nine suicides were confirmed in 2007 . army suicide rates have risen coinciding with the us-led military action in iraq and afghanistan . spending a lot of time in stressful war zones is not good for mental health . <a href=" "> news.bbc.co.uk / 2/hi / ... </a>

NEG the story illustrates the futility of paying ransomes for kidnappings , as it only encourages more listen to the talibans response to a previous deal
NEG i think we can all agree that it is israel and it 's supporters who have a problem with the facts , as we have all seen on these mb 's . and rejecting terroism does not upset me at all . i think we all should , where ever it comes from . however. , what i find rather ironic is this same person would have been called a terrorist by that same judafacist mouth piece , only last week . but today , he is some they can use for thier propaganda .

NEG the holocaust is a tragedy . the statistics show that approx 6 million were murdered . i 'm sorry if this confuses you .
NEG agreed , clinton , way too much baggage and a husband with direct link to the white house , very odd dynamic .

NEG `` what planet are you on ?????? you dont count the umproviked rocket attacks by hammas on israel as breaking the ceasefire then ??? thats ok in your eyes , israel had approx 6 months of this before they did something . so tell us again who broke the ceasefire '' read this and then apologize and admit you were wrong and uninformed . <a href=" ">
NEG well as you 've run away from actually arguing your case and have replaced it with stock insults it is getting very easy for us . no wonder you regard john wayne as a hero , he must seem a towering intellectual to you and granty .
NEU how would you have stopped it ?
NEG mistress you have muslim neighbours . i find that very hard to believe . how do you manage to live there ? no one finds the sight of a woman vulgar unless you are trying to tell us something about yourself . it would n't surpirse me because you come across as a vulgar and vile woman anyway . muslims love women and treat them with the respect that they deserve . something you obviously would know nothing about .
NEG `` is n't it a petty thing to have a go at him for ? '' perhaps . but i would n't set myself up by trying to defend him either . when someone enjoys the sound of their own voice as much as does bho , odds are there 'll be the occasional self important silliness . best we laugh at this guy now rather than have foreign leaders laughing at him later . i know you want us to be gentle on him but why ? this is quite probably the most important job in the world and you want to give him a pass ?
NEG america feels it is right to attack al quada and taliban positions . if in doing so there are innocent people killed -- so be it . on the other side al quada felt it had a reason for attacking america and the twin tower and if innocent people are killed so be it . so it goes around and around and around . and in the circle of mayhem and violence -- so many innocent people are killed . one is no better than the other -- and far as the innocent perishing . no one side can call the other bad / evil / vicious without labelling them self exactly the same . no one involved can call the other a ` terrorist with exposing themselves as a terrorist

POS i 'm from lincolnshire , and we do n't think of it as `` surrounded on all sides by water '' or even `` surrounded on three sides by water and on the other side by scotland '' . to many in east anglia , lincolnshire , humberside and the east riding of yorkshire , the north sea is not so much a barrier as a road . it does n't so much divide us from the continent as it connects us to holland and denmark . -LRB- that 's probably why , for example , norwich airport has flights to amsterdam and copenhagen but not to london . it 's also why hull , the seventh largest city in england , is seen by many as a backwater . -RRB-

POS if people are willing to pay then good on them . market forces , supply and demand and all that .
NEG both musso and hitler were christians . hitler told germmany he was doing god 's work . but seeing as you see things that way , how can you therefore claim that terrorism carrying out acts in the name of islam are true muslims ? you apply different rules in your reasoning and are never consistent .
NEU / / their side of the story is poorer than the one i presented ; nonexistent wmds and a clear and present danger where there could n't possibly have been one . / / that 's your opinion and your entitled to it . however i will not take saddam 's side of the story at face value , he was not remotely trustworthy and in my opinion cooked up the whole story of kuwait stealing iraqi oil as a smokescreen to cover up the real reason for the invasion : he had bankrupted the iraqi economy and simply set out to plunder his wealthier neighbour , look at the widespread and systematic looting carried out by his forces in kuwait . / / i will condemn atrocities committed in kuwait that you 've made reference to but believe that iraq did and does have an historic claim on kuwait as iraqi territory . however , i concede that the un would have been a better arbiter in such a claim as opposed to the unilateral invasion that iraq undertook . / / i agree .
NEG al qaeda will not be making a base in iran - that 's ridiculous , as they hate the shia almost as much as they hate everyone else in the world .

NEG message posted by colonelartist i am sure the americans soldiers who went wild and killed innocent people in jalabad didnt also mean to kill ... what is it that you people like to call it when the west doesnt mean to kill but still kills ? collateral damage or something . . ---------- can you for once post on the topic ? stop going off into left field .
POS are you advocating that any minority be it large or small has the right to independence no matter were they live ?
NEG tony silver one day your a man of peace the next day your showing your true colours fact is you have shown many times that your an anti semite and a bigot . you spell jew or israel in anyway you like i dont really care it changes nothing about yout attitude .
NEG yeah . that is right . those nazis were easy push overs as we know from seeing repeats of ` hogan 's heroes . ' a few unarmed jews could have easily bested them . the russians , brits , us , and other allies only took three years of concentrated effort destroying the nazi war machine because they wanted to pro-long the lucrative war machinery contract buying . sheesh !
NEG just imagine ! jordan is one of the few arab states that has doplomatic relation with that arrogant state . it was the obligation of israel to inform jordan before this sad tragedy happened . but i believe that israel was more interested in protecting its citizens avoiding them not to visit jordan , and that is all . israel is this kind of `` friends '' ! peace is good for the israeli and palestinian children , as this kind of atrocities will sadly make many peaceful muslims turn radicals .
NEU well , mods , i have to say that now you 've got me interested . what is it specifically about mondial that means we are not allowed to ridicule him ? p.s. is there some way you can make him tell us what these `` eu mutuals '' are and how they improve healthcare ?
NEG the girl wants her mum , she was scared and devastated when her mum was kidnapped . and now that yvonne has `` found '' islam , she could n't care less about her daughters feelings . if you are a parent your child comes first , full stop .

NEG ps why ` gustav ' ? i must say my immediate thoughts went to mahler as i am a mahler , nut , -LRB- recent anniversary btw -RRB- , but maybe more likely is the german philosopher gutav hempel who emmigrated to the usa around the mid 90 's . othwerwise google is useless and answering ` why gustav ' ? can you do better ? j

NEG 84 ` suspects ' -LRB- people that the us suspects of something , anything really -RRB- are on hunger strike in america 's concentration camp in cuba - yes , cuba ! the american camp guards are poking tubes up their noses down into their stomachs to force feed them , which is painful and making them sick . how many more indecent acts committed in their name will americans put up with ?
NEG i think that ms. royal 's sudden rise in popularity can be seen , from a european perspective , as a conveniant counter-balance to the new german chancellor . who will inevitably fall at the final fence in respect of a transatlantic tariff removal . neither the u.s. or the french will agree to an end to subsidies to farmers , which would be prerequisite for any such removal of tariffs . funny how the `` leader of the free world '' manages its own economy along the same lines as the `` cheese-eating surrender monkeys '' !
NEG `` why do n't you ? '' because i did n't make this claim , you did . `` i 'm sure you know what i 'm talking about though '' i have no idea . `` you 'll never admit it until it stares you in the face , of course '' . in order to have it `` stare me in the face '' you 're going to have to support what you said . can you ?
NEG \ \ i 'm really very impressed with the effort you went to in gathering those quotes , captainlogic , and i recall most of them myself . \ \ grant , i can assure you that the effort was minimal . one minute of searching produces scores of such comments -LRB- and worse -RRB- from the us right wing , ironically the people you seem to identify with most closely . and those quotes are recent -LRB- from the last 1 to 3 years -RRB- , so your claim that things have changed does n't ring true . \ \ we are very close , and canada could n't want for better neighbours . \ \ thats not how it appears , at least for some . another quote i saw was that `` canada needs the us , but the us does not need canada '' and please do n't try to speak for europeans in their entirety . if course there are differences between eu member states , but for the most part we get along just fine . you should stop gleaning your world view from rabid right wing media and actually come and visit us over here some time .

NEG yes , this is a hugely good point . ` no goggles , no singing !

NEG looks like the civilian engineers were engaged in well-digging and reservoir engineering . trying to bring fresh water and sanitation to the iraqi population merits a death sentence in azania 's book .
NEU grant , why do you and jj insist on using personal attacks when some one disagrees or just refuses to argue with you ? i have no intentions of continuing this argument because i am never going to change your mind , nor do i wish to . it is just not worth my time or energy , as i am sure it is not worth your time or energy . you must have better things to do with your time than try to argue a point with some one who does not share your point of view or your convictions or beliefs or anything really , other than the love of travel . if you were a dear friend , then it would be worth my while as your friendship would mean a great deal to me , however , you are a stranger , nothing more . i do not take anything anyone says on these boards seriously , it 's strictly to pass the time for me as i sit through conference calls , nothing more . as it should be for you , strictly to pass the time . so , live long and prosper , rita .

POS hi ozy , it is quite interesting to hear you say this because one of the ongoing debates on this board is the re-electing of bush vs. the re-electing of blair . uk posters often say that they find it incomprehendible that americans re-elected bush . when us posters in-turn ask uk why blair was re-elected , we are often told it was because of domestic issues and that voters felt blair was very strong on internal british interests . and here you are suggesting that mr. blair did not take british interests seriously . of course there is always going to be differing opinion . but from what we have generally heard on these boards , the one positive attribute that most uk posters have praised mr. blair on was a strong policy of british interest .
NEG here is your independence day , so read it and weep : <a href=" "> we evil white brits are damned if we do , and damned if we do n't . your lot though , you do n't even aspire to the damned . you just hold your head up high while beating the poor , the sick and the elderly . you 're ruled by a class of people unto themeselves , those who by their very actions gave colonalism a good name a looooong time ago . congrats .

NEG `` maybe you can account for the brits emigrating ... could it be the weather ? the rising crime ? the high taxes ? the muslim / african / eastern european immigration stresses ?

NEG `` everywhere but quebec , dear '' . darn ! i 'm going to miss her .
NEG i 'm not sure you and the others understand . the grand mufti angle , -LRB- and all your other propaganda angles -RRB- has no impact on anyone . my enemys enemy is my friend ? look at who britain have teamed up with in the past , and the damage we have caused . including palestine . palestine was wiped off the map . what year did the mufti meet hitler ? the holocaust wasnt suggested until about december 1941 , according to jewish holocaust experts . like i say though , this along with most of the other hate propaganda has no impact . probably makes western subliminally pro-israeli neutral gentiles more sympathetic to pals .

NEG piltdown ` the us signed a convention outlawing all chemical weapons in 1972 . ' yes but this is another of those moot points , like napalm and white phophorous etc , ie the use of the chemical is not specifically aimed at people , eg the dioxin example was to clear forestation . people become ` collateral damage ' or ` should not be in the area ' or should not eat the fish or drink the water or eat the plants etc contaminated by dioxin , depleted uranium etc. nor should civilians be around when cluster bombs are used , nor should children play with them , nor should people , especially civilians and children step on land mines which are only sown to kill the enemy , and so on and so on . i suspect we have a long way to go in controlling some of the more horrendous weapons of war . j

NEG way of life ? that would indicate it is the daily norm . do you know how many total high schools and universities there are in the us ? yes , these events are tragic , but certainly not the norm . if that were the case or if it were a `` way of life '' you would hear about it happening a dozen times a year . not a few times over the course of a dozen years . to say something is both yearly and annual is redundant . but please provide the factual data to back this up . please list the last 10 years lets say and list the `` way of life '' school shootings for each of those years . as i understand it , youth violence is on the rise in the europe - specifically in the uk where its being reported that gangs are becoming increasingly violent and beginning to use more handguns . are you saying your government does not allow you to assess your own mental stability ? how do they stop you ? have they implanted surveillance chips into your brain ? which is why you no doubt felt the need to be on your soap-box about it . and you make this statement on a poll that you conducted amongst `` most americans '' data gathered from the same poll no doubt ?
NEU i do n't know why the catholic hierarchy crucifies itself with this decades-long sex obsession -LSB- ever since the advent of easily available contraception for all -RSB- . in developed countries contraception is used by almost all catholics -LSB- else why would family size be so low -RSB- . my -LSB- catholic -RSB- mother - in all other respects fully observant - used contraception from the early 1950s on to limit her family to 2 without feeling her adopted faith compromised . the hierarchy here has had to turn a very blind eye to lay practice and the laity has had to make its own peace with god about this , sidestepping the clergy . focus on this issue has undermined the authority of the church and attempting to shore it up in africa is going to fail too . talk about flogging a dead horse . the use of condoms in the context of aids is a health issue and could be justified even by the catholic hierarchy on that basis - any contraceptive effect being an ` unfortunate ' side-effect , just as - say - treatment for cancer might involve a person becoming sterile as a side effect . no-one argues that they should n't be treated for cancer on account . aids is just as deadly .

NEG perfectly true -- and it was only at the insistence of tony blair that britain entered iraq . tony wanted to be accepted as a member of the ` rat pack ' and followed the u.s. blindly . he had ears only for the white house and would not listen to his mps , party members , or the british electorate . iraq certainly was not a bed for terrorists before the invasion -- but tony and george ploughed that region and look at the deadly harvest iraq and the world is now reaping .
NEG / / / haesten , what exactly is your problem with gay people ? / / / i do n't think haesten - has a problem with gay people . it 's the other way round gays think people have to kowtow to them !
NEG you made the claim , the onus is on you to back it up or be a man and admit you made it up . if you want to make me look stupid , then post your evidence . if you want to continue to make you look stupid , do n't . p.s. if i knew it to be true , i would n't have challenged you in the first place .
NEG it seems that a username of ` talmudist ' is acceptable even though it would be offensive to jews . therefore , since the bbc allows it i am sure they will allow me to call myself ` koranist ' .
NEG smoker surely you are not quite as daft as your message . the americans want to control the oil to stop anyone else controlling it , in particular their enemies . thats why they are in alliance with saudi arabia , and is why their worst nightmare would be if islamist extremists were to take control of saudi arabia . the small states in the gulf are either in alliance with america , or have american bases there , or both . you see america has to make sure it can get oil , and on favourable terms . thats whats meant by controlling the oil . there is also the question of dollars vs euros . thats a question i 'll leave alone for the minute . china is an expanding market for oil and american does want to make sure china doesnt get all the worlds oil , for it would mean the yanks could n't drive around in their big humvees , and that would never do . cheers .
NEG `` i think the europeans do not understand the levels of incompetence in our government .

NEG surely the richest country on the planet can do better than this ? <a href=" "> news.bbc.co.uk / 1/hi / ... </a>
NEG of course it is . zimbabwe just proves how sickeningly opportunist and false all the rhetoric from the iraq hawks about ` humanitarian intervention ' was . the neocons in america and labour hawks here see nothing to gain by invading zimbabwe , whereas there was much to gain by invading iraq . saddam 's human rights record was a smokescreen to hide the real motives of the iraq invasion .
NEU you mean like eating and working and sleeping ?
NEG no just dangerous . what happens if a lump flies off and slams into the moon destabilising it 's orbit , causing tidal waves . or worse still canons off the moon and hits the earth . my god the americans are going to kill us all . george w was right , no need to worry about global warming we 're all going to die soon .

NEU a unified position by the quartet is absolutely required to force peace . we 're tired of the circle of violence . there must not be individual counry wavering like chirac did with iran -LRB- chirac : `` it 's ok if iran has nukes . hey do n't quote me on that ! '' -RRB- .
NEG `` this is a general post script to hothousemat , puydedome , astute ann & all selective humanists on this board . selective humanists are those people who will preach fire & brimstone against any wrongdoing '' `` the selective humanists , demand that the jews should have different rules . i rest my case . '' well , well , well . for someone who does n't like racism and uneven-handed behaviour , ben sure knows how to pigeonhole ! i 've explained myself previously in this thread . from what i wrote there , it is obvious that ben 's latest post does n't apply to me and , therefore , i can only assume that ben has either skimped in respect of reading it , or has a cognitive malfunction . in either case , his posts are so one-sided that they deserve nothing but contempt . calling people `` racist '' when they 're not is unacceptable behaviour in my book . so i 'll treat his posts with the contempt that they deserve .
NEG `` hitler , by the way , did this same thing in his time . because of `` terrorists '' he needed some new special powers '' . so you feel that the united states is on the road to a dictatorship and national socialism , do you gagarin ? i do n't see those fears being expressed in the us at all , apart from those with easily excited imaginations . what do you think should happen to potential terrorists ? and what makes you believe there is no definition for terrorism ?
NEG oh you are a swinger both ways . first its `` jews have no rights to be in israel '' - now its `` jews need to be in israel to fulfill the messiah prophecy -LRB- that muslims do n't accept '' talk about being desperate for a cause .
NEG '' '' the point is that it was n't just jewish immigration that occured but massive arab immigration aswell '' '' and where exactly did i deny the fact that there was arab immigration ? i know there was both arab and jewish immigration , but the jewish immigration far outnumbered the number of arabs who were coming into the region , because unlike the jews there was a good number of arab 's who fled the region as well . '' '' this myth about ` palestinians ' having lived in the land for 1000s of years is simply that , a myth '' '' obviously you 're completely ignoring everything i have said thus far . the point here is there have always been muslim 's in that region for the past 1000 years that have outnumbered the jews . therefore , the current palestinian 's have had far more ancestors living over the past millenia then the number of israeli ancestors , since most of them are all immigrants and therefore have no traceable family history in the region before the 20th century . '' '' is there a library near you ? go and read ` from time immemorial ' by joan peters '' '' lol , this alone explains why you have such a one sided and narrow minded view on this . the fact that you rely on a book which is engineered towards promoting a tired old excuse which has been debated to death does you no favours whatsoever .
POS a 6.3 magnitude earthquake hit sumatra , killing at least 70 people . no risk of a tsunami since the epic center was on land rather than beneath the ocean . living in an earthquake-prone area , i can sympathize with those who experienced the quake . my thoughts are with the families of the victims killed in the quake .

NEU scheherazade did you really mean to post a thread that shows israel in a good light ? < < < that is true.but i was expecting to see israel in a better position . i believe that the palestinian fatah should be number one in corruption . do you agree ?
NEG i know you are keen to deflect from the current issue and the post i have made . the truth ? i dont think you are able to recognise the truth . if you have a need to discuss darfur and the sudan , withref to the uk/usa involvement in that country , in creating a civil war -LRB- oil related -RRB- then feel free to start a new thread .

NEG and i should trust them ? no one knows everything . ------------------------------------------------ i know everything ... but do i want to enlighten your mind ? nope ... i was not encourged to passively receive information and i dont like others to lazily accept information without any proof on the bases of false evidence ... otherwise i would be a westerner and believed in the stories told by your leaders , retold by your media and had actually believed that iraq had wmd or the stuff you are told everyday .

NEU and christian world .
NEG the difference between the turkish situation and the nazi holocaust is that the ideology and administration in germany was removed by ww2 and prosecuted providing eventually for a measure of closure for germany and a separation of the modern federal republic from that era . however in turkey , the young turk revolution was central to the nationalist rather than religious nature of the armenian genocide and even after the governments takeover by ataturk massacres continued . the genocide is intertwined with the birth of the modern turkish state and not something that can be `` blamed '' on the old ottoman authorities . therefore recognition of the genocide imperils modern turkey in a way which neither germany or even japan have had to deal with . add to this the treatment of the kurds by the turkish goverment all makes this a modern issue and not a historical one .
NEU apparently so reluctant to share background information ? i do n't divide this board 's members into ` anti jews , anti muslims , anti us or anti europeans . i do divide it into sincere posters and wum 's but beyond that i tend to divide it into those with and without a sense of humour and , for the purpose of this post , into those who i ` know ' and do n't know . i find that background information , particularly the sharing of it , makes posters more ` real ' and i tend to debate with these ` real ' board members much as i would with colleagues over dinner or down the pub -- whether we agree or strongly disagree is irrelevant . do you have similar perspectives or do you think that what posters say and how they say it is more important than ` who or what they are ' ? j ps i appreciate this is hardly ` world news ' , except to say i also believe that discussions between world leaders are also influenced by ` personal chemistry ' intangibles as much as by the various other key factors .

NEG so does this toilet cost $ 1 and is not built to last that is what made in china means isnt it . . cheap but bad quality just hope it doesnt break down just after somebody has used it so better to be safe than sorry and use an american $ 1 million toilet that was built to last if though china does start getting involved in space in a big way then for the americans it can go 2 ways . 1 -RRB- it will lead to greater cooperation and possibly lead to better relations with the china . 2 -RRB- it will mean the us is going to start doing things for political reasons but which have very little scientific value ... the appolo program was simply about beating the russians to the moon all they did was plant flags , play golf and do a little off road driving and the only 1 scienitst was ever sent who understood geology and other such things and he was on the very last of the appolo missions . what we do not want is america carrying out pointless programs just so they can say look we were the first ones to do it if somethihng is going to be done at all it must be for a very good reason and have scientific value .
NEG `` it is a regular tactic of yours to turn an expression of opinion into a question that gives a completely different version of that expression '' . that 's because i believe these statements are not thought through and contains fuzzy logic . you seldom are able to respond to these questions but instead complain that they are asked . on the other hand you offer statements i never made and pigeonhole me in positions that are n't mine . while you may believe this to be honest , i do n't . i 'll withdraw the remark with the understanding that you 'll quote me directly in the future rather than trying to make a counterargument against me from memory .
NEG the acts of hizbollah out of lebanon , are a direct provocation on israel , a declaration of war . israel 's reactions are heavy handed , short-sighted and unbalanced . it had a clear right to react , but its chosen manner is brutish and reckless . israel is one of the nations that exceeds in digging its own hole . these are the facts .
NEU when will the palestinians be ready to be trusted with running themselves ? ------------------------------------------------ when they will be given total freedom , all at once ... not in installments . . not like the dysfunctional parents of a 16 yr ofd who dont give him the keys to the house and lock the door at 9 pm when all his friends are still out , just because he has `` shown `` no reponsiblity because he comes back to his house through the window . give him the keys and then question his responsiblity ...
NEG does n't executed mean put to death ?
NEG insightful one , you are simply being dishonest . they were told that they were to be executed immediately and blind folded and made to stand against a wall in front of firing squad and terrorised in other ways . that is what we are told by the sailors and why do you disbelieve them ? this is not the uk government talking but private individuals . i note you seem to have only a tenuous grasp on truth but perhaps others including these citizens have slightly higher standards than you
NEU windy and mcguiness do that too , its nothibg new .
NEG the iraqi people voted for democracy . the coalition want to help them get democracy . the islamic lunatics will do everything they can to stop the west succeeding because it will show up iran -LRB- and al queda and all the criminals in the middle east -RRB- and what they really stand for : anarchists .
NEG we are n't going to agree helen . the anti-semitism in that case is incidental , finegold 's offence in kl 's eyes -LRB- and mine too -RRB- is his choice of employer . and the fuss made over any anti-semitism is politically inspired . just as the `` anti-semitism '' detected when pro-israelis start losing an argument is politically inspired . when anti-semitism is used by a bit of low life like finegold to gain the moral high ground the i refuse to accept it is a valid charge .

POS hi speed ! sorry for not coming back to your comments earlier , my day got busy ... `` i have mixed feelings about it vina . '' yes . so do i , which is why i posted the question . there are so many possibilities and different scenarios , that i think we can only point at the most general and usual cases . so i think that that is why the harrison ford case is not applicable to most people . certainly this is millionaire celebrity and given his financial status , as you said , he will not be confronted with the typical cases of not being able to pay babysitting for the not so pleasant tasks j , more time available for parenting , etc. '' perhaps in some ways even a better parent as they would have years more wisdom and life experience to pass along , be more mature themselves than say a very young parent might be . '' yes that may be a positive thing , but also the bigger the generational gap the most difficult it may be to understand each other . '' so , i think that a given persons financial stability , emmotional readiness , maturity level and frame of time to actually spend with the child - particularly during the early developemental years , plays more of a significant role in what sort of parent they will make than does their age . '' lets face it , its just like that harry chapin song `` cats in the cradle '' '' i love that song ... . `` by the time most kids are in their late teens and beyond , they dont spend all that much time with their parents anyway. : '' true . this is however more than not the rule of life , but by the time children pass the teenage stage , get into adulthood and most of all , as they become parents themselves , then they will start `` respecting '' their parents again and begin to understand in retrospect why their parents acted the way they did ... so parents now become the best friends , allies and advisers . this is the part that i see as downside when having children late in life ... now in the case of this woman in the article , she had twins . speed , i can tell you how i was super-handful with one ! so even as a young person , i was exhausted all the time ! and the second baby came less than 2 years after -LRB- i know the same was for you -RRB- ... so how this woman , who naturally wont have all the energy of a person in her 20s or 30s , will be able to cope with newborn twins !!!? or she may turn out to do better than all of us !

' <br> <br> except <br> <br> -LRB- a -RRB- the maintenance of systems , equipment , or facilities , including maintenance associated with any permissible uses of funds described in paragraph -LRB- 1 -RRB- ; <br> <br> -LRB- b -RRB- modernization , renovation , or repair of stadiums or other facilities primarily used for athletic contests or exhibitions or other events for which admission is charged to the general public ; <br> <br> -LRB- c -RRB- modernization , renovation , or repair of facilities -- <br> <br> -LRB- i -RRB- used for sectarian instruction , religious worship , or a school or department of divinity ; or <br> <br> -LRB- ii -RRB- in which a substantial portion of the functions of the facilities are subsumed in a religious mission ; or <br> <br> -LRB- d -RRB- construction of new facilities . <br> <br> <br> so , while the money can be used for projects in facilities that are primarily used for instruction ... if the facility is primarily used for instruction in religion -LRB- such as a school of divinity -RRB- , then the grant money can not be used to renovate or improve that facility . at least 25 percent of the grant money has to be spent on green building projects . <br> <br> i 'm not certain if that bit in the bill is discriminatory , though it seems likely , as the wording is vague -LRB- how much usage is ` substantial ' ? -RRB- ; the government withholds money that would be granted for improvements to facilities used for any other type of instruction . <br> <br> not exactly equal treatment under the eyes of the lawmakers . <br> <br> demint appears to have been grandstanding with his proposed amendment : <br> <br> ` to allow the free exercise of religion at institutions of higher education that receive funding under section 803 of division a ' <br> <br> that said , i think the entire bill is a travesty , as you do n't get out of debt by digging ever deeper into your creditor 's pockets . <br> <br> the complete text of the bill : <br>

NEG my heart hurts for this family . i feel for both partners , and their children . we live in ca , and in a non-religious hospital i was very disappointed when hospital staff refused to answer my questions as to my partner 's emergency room visit , which was under circumstances much less severe than what happened to the family in this article . the lgbt community faces so much discrimination and lack of respect in so many ways . the fact that this family did all they legally could , had all the right paperwork not to mention the legal expenses that go along with all of that , not to mention 17 years of life shared together and still their was no regard for their relationship , and the fact that they were a ` family ' by hospital staff when one of them was dying , scares the shit out of me , the doma laws need to be repealed . i think the involved hospital staff , and the heads of the hospital should all have to go through diversity sensitivity classes , and i hope the hospital looses this case and has to pay the family an exorbitant amount of money . sometimes the pocketbook is the best place to hit in order for such lessons to be learned .

NEG misleading ? perhaps , but do n't judge the speaker harshly . it 's rather difficult to explain it succinctly and accurately to the layman . let me give it a shot . <br> <br> the fact is all our best descriptions of the universe treat time and space on a very similar footing . you may choose not to call time a dimension ; words are just words , so that 's your perogative . but in fact time is something very similar to a dimension , and in the mathematical sense of the word it certainly qualifies . <br> <br> in fact the basic difference is , time has a ` minus ' sign in a couple of key equations , while the three space dimensions each have a ` plus ' sign . -LRB- well , the other difference is it 's measured in years instead of meters , but that problem 's solvable . one light year is fundamentally one ` year ' of distance ; that 's why physicists use light years ! -RRB- <br> <br> now it 's true , that minus sign makes time a very different beast from space . but in a mathematical sense it 's still a dimension , and spacetime is a four-dimensional manifold of some strange structure we do n't know everything about yet .
NEG is that all of them ? it does n't seem like that many for the whole internet .

NEG aww ... * studies *
NEG obligatory comment that is obligatory .
NEG i 'm on the side of the free staters , you ninnies ! house resolutions are one thing . actually defending yourself from a belligerent federal government is something else entirely . several states have brought up this ` declare sovereignty ' thing and what does it change ? they all still take federal money for their schools , permit unconstitutional federal agencies to meddle in their citizens ' lives , and roll over for the exact same jurisdictional power grabs as always . <br> <br> what a state * really * needs to do in order for all this celebrating to be justified , is to pass a law that flies directly in the face of unconstitutional federal policies , and back it up with lethal force . for example , new hampshire could decriminalize marijuana , and arrest any federal agent that attempts to harass anyone for possession .
NEG it does n't have to be a nonprofit , or big volunteer effort . it 's the little miracles , the little bits of compassion and energy that we give to others that accumulate in personal excellence everyday and amount to growth of character and strength in spirit . do unto others is not just an adage but a way of being . and this is n't just for weekend warriors . think about it the next time you step over a homeless person in the street on your way to where ever .

NEG the human being created civilization not because of willingness but of a need to be assimilated into higher orders of structure and meaning . the individual desires judgment . without that desire , the cohesion of groups is impossible , and so is civilization . first , judgment came from the gods . then , it came from celebrity -LRB- the observation and judgment of others -RRB- . now we can implement the same functionality with data-mining algorithms - our next judge will probably be an omni-present self-aware system that we build ourselves , which eerily echos voltaire .

NEG the current beer tax in oregon , according to the story i saw on the news , said the current tax is less than one cent per pint . while i 'd say -LRB- as an oregonian and a beer drinker -RRB- this is too minimal , and i * would * support a tax increase -LRB- we have such a budget shortfall here they 're talking about closing all the public schools in april because we ca n't afford to keep 'em open -RRB- , an 1800 % jump is n't a reasonable amount in my book . <br> <br> it should be stated for the record that a barrel of beer equals two kegs , so a $ 50 tax per barrel works out to $ 25 per 15.5 gallon keg , or about 20 cents per pint at a bar . <br> <br> of course , area brewers here are claiming it 's going to raise the cost of a pint by $ 2 , which is ridiculous .

' <br> <br> and after reading the testimony of spc. brandon neely and realizing that we still have people who have been in those cages -LRB- see the picture in the following -RRB- for 6 or 7 years every day counts . <br> this is not just a national embarrassment it becomes a crime to which all of us are a party if we do not take steps to urge our elected officials to take action . and to open investigations and prosecutions .
NEG the 50 's and 60 's had the highest percentage of union jobs in american history . it was also when americans as a whole had the highest standard of living and the country was at the height of its prosperity . unions increase wages , which increase consumption , which stimulate production , which increases wealth . you do the math . the reaganomics idea that making people poor somehow benefits the economy ... well , we 've seen how that 's worked out , have n't we ?

NEG you 're still trying to categorically lump in-vitro fertilization together with more noble pursuits such as fertility medications . <br> <br> i 'm talking specifically about in-vitro fertilization , not the more benign treatments like fertility drugs . <br> <br> you 're also making an emotional appeal in trying to draw a parallel between the physically disabled , and those who are deliberately determined to procreate at any cost . <br> <br> really , ld , i expected better than that of you .

NEG @ darkshroud re : ' . . add in a low resource usage av like nod32 ' <br> <br> and that is why you fail . how about installing an os that does n't need an anti-virus product to work properly ?

NEG what part does n't make sense ? i do have some microbiology classes under my belt do you ? <br> <br> bacteria of all sorts are not good for you in certain doses . good bacteria can run a muck and cause disease too . we call them good bacteria because they are naturally part of the fauna of our bodies and in normal numbers they contributes to our health . when their numbers are too great they cause disease . whole milk spoils as well . <br> <br> outside of the environment they are acclimatized to -LRB- adapted to -RRB- the bovine body those bacteria will likely not do as well giving room for other bacteria to grow . many bacteria will be introduced at all levels of industrial handling and if those bacteria grow faster than the natural bovine fauna then you get dangerous whole milk . part of the reason why pasteurization was mandated int he first place was the rampant cases of food poisoning due to bacteria introduced into the milk and which did better than the ones already in the milk . <br> <br> think of yeast infections . yeast is a natural part of the fauna of human female genitalia but when there is a sudden shift in numbers or a ph shift which kills the yeast you can get an infection of either an over abundance of natural yeast or different strains of yeast . <br> <br>

NEG an easy solution for this is to lower your existing prices that your cellular customers pay . in turn , you induce loyalty and have a much happier and much larger customer base to keep in a broken economy . the cell phone companies have had consumers by the pair for years with the price point your paying compared to what it really costs them on the bottom line . <br> <br> it is true they have dumped some of the money back into better carrying technology and other notable positives , yet a price reduction should be on the foreground if they want to stay competitive and keep profit shares up in a longterm bubble .
NEG no 1929 was due -LRB- in part -RRB- to protectionism in america -LRB- is the ` buy american ' clause still in the bailout ?? -RRB- . but given a choice between being governed by corporations or being governed by a swollen interventionist state i choose the former

POS hillyi take your earlier point buti would like to support any new runners that take up the flm challenge . in june 2001 i had a kidney removed following 4 years of serious illness . i had never ran races before but 8 months later i completed the 2002 flm in 5 hours , not fast i know , but i did not find it that hard-really !! and i enjoyed every minute and raised 2000 pounds for charity . i have a golden bond again to do it this year . providing you put in sensible training , and respect the distance , i really believe anyone can do it , good luck to everyone
NEU i ran reading half yesterday and was really pleased with my time and thought generally it was well organised , however what did disappoint me -LRB- aside from teh 45 min delay -RRB- was the number of slower runners that started at the front despite there being markers to indicate times . i have to admit that i was in the box ahead of where i should have been but one comment i heard was ` ooh it says sub - 1:20 , perhaps we should move back ' . the reply was ` no it will take us ages to cross the line ' . i finished in 1.29 officially but it still took me 1 1/2 minutes to cross the line so my actual time was 1:27 , and for the entire race i continually overtook people . i was glad i didnt start further back with the sub 1.30 where i should have been . but if it had been managed properly , then you wouldnt get people trying to start in a higher ability group and slow down those behind them who are in the correct group .
NEU dare we hope then ?
NEU getting better ... 9 -LRB- ish -RRB- in 1.24 - even included some hills -LRB- definitely not grade a fell ! -RRB- .
POS done my domestic duty and just about to go for a 10 mile run . . hilly - i think i enjoy the training more than the actual racing . it is nice to get away from it all , go off-road for a few hours and switch off completely . 25 miles tomorrow with some others from the club , almost all off-road followed by podretta 's 7th birthday party -LRB- olympics party at the leisure centre -RRB- . lots of carbs in jelly and ice cream !
POS -LRB- stops lurking -RRB- . hi all - . hope you do n't mind me joining in at this late stage - i 've spent the last few weeks having a dilemma about what my target time is so which forum to join ! it 's my first marathon , longest run was a 21 miler last week , 3:30 - so i 'm hoping for sub 4:30 , allowing for the unknown of the last few miles . . it has been really good to read everyone 's ups and downs on the forum - this week is definitely `` feeling overtrained '' week , hoping the various niggles settle down during the taper . hope everyone enjoys the shorter long runs tomorrow - i 'm doing 13 miles -LRB- along the thames , boat race course there and back -RRB- . great not to be running in the ice and cold any more ! jezza
NEU katie , what a nightmare - well done for picking yourself up and your pb ! champagne - i 've printed off a split time thing off nikerunning.com , specifically for new york , allowing for all the ups and downs - first mile - 8:46 , 2nd mile 7:29 . its absolutely wicked . i 'll try and stick to it for as long as i can !! . as i have had no build up races as preparation - except a 10k which i pb 'd at 42:48 a couple of weeks ago , i 'm not sure of my level at present . ooops caps lock !!
POS congratulations , tillyp !! well done nikster ! -LRB- got ta get out running again soon -RRB-
NEG mrs t - first serious attempt at the distance/time as gr said ca n't be a 100 % confident unsure of my mp endurance the furthest i have gone is 14 miles @ mp . my race tactics will be to get 20 miles in 2:10 - 2:15 and then hang on for dear life . is this a good plan ?????
NEU annick , try they do baked beans and marmite vests amongst others . not sure if that 's what you were thinking of .
NEU best of luck to everyone in gp 7 tomorrow !
NEU morning , . t map , jej , mrs t , dan a , ndo w , cy , blisters , oo , rb-congratulations and commiserations . great reports . ndo , i hope you are all right . 3 hours 6:51 : for me . 1h29 at half way and just on time by 20 miles , but i had very tight hamstrings which were cramping up so i slowed to a pace that allowed me to get to the finish without stopping . i have mixed feelings this morning . the marathon is such an unnatural distance to run . anyway it 's great to be able to listen to your thoughts about the race and the banter and support on this thread has been fantastic this year . -LRB- people at work who have n't got a clue are already annoying me with their advice and anecdotes . -RRB- . all the best and recover well . no running for me till saturday and i have mayo on my sarnies at lunch today . i agree with dan a - . tapering is over-rated .
NEG bet i hold the record , i took six on sunday morning before the start !!!!!!!! i know it was a really stupid thing to do but had the runs from wednesday night until saturday morning & lived on a diet of jam sandwiches & 6 pints of watered down lucozade sport per day , though little stayed inside . . this was my third flm & i figured that even if i had to walk most of it , as long as i could stay bunged up i could complete and justifiably collect my sponsorship money . . as it turned out they worked a treat , i managed 4:27 which was about half an hour slower than i targeted before my illness . i was also back to normal service by tuesday morning . . however i would never advise anybody to run a marathon whilst ill , it was the most physically painful thing i have ever done .
POS thanks diana ... we 're not off til next wednesday ... you 've got to put up with me for another week yet !
POS missed your last post - but you can pick up some fab costume accessories these days , from the high street . next , m + s , debenhams , top shop etc , you do n't need to spend much or go searching far off the high street - i 've had some nice cheap bling from sainsburys even .
POS thought i would try out these <u> lovely </u> buttons ! .
NEG i dont think you can defer a club place joe but its still worth asking .
POS sure this was n't on the website yesterday !!!
POS no , just from highams park - was 5 miles . only back up to 10k at the minute ! yes , just read about paula , inspirational ! my brother -LRB- he was on the bus with us flm 07 morning -RRB- , ran his first dublin marathon last monday . 4 hrs dead . fab time for him .
POS . can you believe that our charity ... the blue cross have placed themselves up 2 flights of stairs ? yikes ! after a long run , i love a glass of cold milk and some hazelnuts . hope they have some as a reward for dragging myself up there !
POS nah , it 'll be scott ! well done hana - like i said , it 's already on sky + so looking forward to sitting down with a very very large glass of a decent rioja and watching you on monday evening !
POS just wanted to say a huge good luck to jason at katrina for tomorrow - hope you have a great run and enjoy the atmosphere !! katrina , hope the cold is gone . roo - well done on your pb ! sorry to hear about your friend 's baby , hope all is ok . xx . roo/legs - i will prob watch on tv , but if i can make it down i will text you .

POS i 'm back from my fab weekend in carlise . lovely country house hotel , too much food and drink and no running at all . will have to get back to it tomorrow . watched the boys play rugby in sleet and gusting wind . was totally drenched and freezing cold afterwards but good games . got back to hotel for lovely hot bubbly bath and a bottle of champagne ! ah it sounds like the exams went well . hope you hear soon as the waiting is often harder than the exam . what are longest lsrs that people have planned ? i thought i read that someone was planning 22 and 24 ? is anyone going over 20 ?

POS tr - happy birthday for today . charle w - belated congrats on your sub 3 . i was also wondering what are the main differences between the new and old p & d book ? is it worth buying the new one if i have the old one already ? 8 miles for me again and trying to build by base up in prep for abingdon and nice and steady . cheers
POS there are actually 2 charities involved with this - the hertfordshire community foundation -LRB- an unmbrella organisation for charities in herts -RRB- and the myasthenia gravis association which support sufferers of myasthenia gravis -LRB- a fluctuating muscle weakness -RRB-
POS laugh out loud monique :0 -RRB- .
NEG not worth throwing it all away , but certainly not worth serious or permanent injury . if the pain is still there after a few days rest then think seriously about giving this year a miss and defer to next year.have had to do this myself for this year.disappointed , but having done the race 2 years ago , it 's not just a case of `` only another 6 '' at the end . they were the hardest 6 miles i think i have ever done.better to be running in next years race than not being able to run at all.sorry about the doom and gloom outlook.my brother had an knee injury a few years back and decided to do a race anyway . he now watches me from the side as he really knackered his knee up.if the body says it hurts , do n't do it .
NEU hi all . just to clear up a point . i never knocked the abingdon , just saying its a small race in comp to d flm . what is n't ? i 've heard a few good things about it and it fits nicely between flms . so im defo considering givin it a go . woony
NEG meerkat - i keep trying to access your site but there appears to be a problem . i keep seeing a picture of a ginger minkey - surely that ca n't be right ????

NEG bd says he is not fidgety !
NEU oops ... spud . wibble wobble booooiiiiiing
POS agree with cougie and mr c ;--RRB-
POS i think that whatever marathon you enter you have to approach it with the knowledge that every marathon is different for various reasons ... location , size of event , sponsorship etc. of course the bigger the event the greater the likelyhood the crowd support will be but ofcourse the flm is a league unto it 's own . in regards to future training ... there is a wealth of information on the internet and on this rw site for marathon training depending on what time you want to achieve . the easiest way to find a training schedule is to ` google ' `` marathon training schedules '' and choose one that works for you . jamie , . the key to keeping your legs going on a bit longer is those long traning runs ... getting a few 20 milers under your belt will help in addition to fine tuning your carbohydrate loading , wearing a good pair of running shoes etc etc. the flm is a fantastic marathon but it is n't the only one ! there are plenty of other great marathons out there for you to enjoy . happy running !
POS mwcmf - cba - that 's definately going to be passed on ! nice one !! ooo - good luck in ny . and good luck on the pub crawl that will no doubt follow . after any major race i think you deserve the right to celebrate and doubled with a birthday , well that 's just an excuse to abuse it . i know i did back in may when i ran a half on my 40th birthday . m - it sounds like you 're about to peak or is this just a warm up for an iron man ?
NEU found the thread ...
POS diana i have a 20 year old daughter who is single but as you know she is in australia . i am not keen on asking folks for money either but its amazing how generous some folks can be , once on a meal out with friends , i was n't having much to drink as i was doing rfl the next day , at the end of the evening i was unexpectly given 50 as a donation for the race and i never even asked for it . i have club speed session tonight and hopefully a 16 miler at the weekend . .
POS saqib - good luck for the weekend ! i keep meaning to go onto your charity page and donate - will do soon . let us know how you get on - we want a full run down ! orient - good luck tonight . hope you get some good news soon . good news ! i 've lost 2lbs already - only another 12 to go !
POS hi hh & sdi . thanks for the replys . mrs j did the pengiun plan for her first lm & came in at 5:25 just 2 mins after the pacer . he stopped for a toilet break at 8 miles so she did the rest on her own and never saw him overtake . in the mag i received today it says they do usually 7m/ml up to 12m/ml in min intervals so hopefully they 'll do an 11m/ml which is what she wants . it says to preregister go to this website so i 'll have a look around . . thanks again for trying and good luck all . -LRB- beginning to feel a little jealous though have bigger fish this year . -RRB- . regards . jt
POS thanks fenn . decided to put something in there that was more inspiring for me ! i sprinted for the last 300 yards or so on sunday . in my head i had a big grin on my face but it does n't look like it from the photo . my son said that if i had that much left in me by the end i should have run at a faster pace throughout the race . he admitted that he might be wrong when i had stopped punching him .
POS aber , that 's some kind of cross training you 've got going there , not sure my legs would take kindly to any high or long jumping . bfb & rob , good luck with the long runs , nice and steady does it and leave some good recovery days in the schedule afterwards . sb , sorry to hear you 've been ill , maybe a sensible decision to lower your horizons , hopefully you can enjoy the race with less pressure and still get that big new pb . nl , i 've been doing all my mid to long runs in some nimbus that mrs h bought me for christmas and i thought they were really heavy to start with , my marathon shoes will be mizuno precisions , mostly phsycological i know but they feel much ` faster ' !! last ` big ' speed session yesterday 8 x 800m fast off 90 secs jog recoveries , averaged 3:03 per rep , with a couple of warm up/warm down miles total just over 7 miles . last medium long midweek tonight 12 or 13 . keep well now everyone .

POS ws : . happy birthday !!! now then did someone just mention birthday cake ???? laugh out loud
POS thanks bowi . how do i know if i have the seat at the right height ? when my leg is in the most extended position should it be completely straight or slightly bent ? also if i am doing it for cross training do i have low resistance and go faster or is it better to have higher resistance or is it just about doing a certain distance in a certain time ? i did 5 miles in 21 minutes .
POS a from e. wonderful ! best nights sleep ever-counting sheep.my uncle farmed sheep in the bowland area-i recall him counting in this way . lsr 15 miles then 10 mile race next week . gc dont worry about switching , as long as you get your lsr 's in during the training period , and do not overdo weekly milage !

POS cool if you 're a formula one fan ! . bowi what were you doing in nepal ?
POS good luck with all of the lsrs this weekend guys . as predicted i have done nothing this week but had a great conference - got some excellent results and had some real fun , but workload , late nights and booze have not helped to get me motivated to run . rugby at the weekend together with long drives down through west wales and then cardiff will mean no running till monday and then it gets cold ... but it will have to kick off whatever the weather . have a good time all .
NEU anyone doing cranleigh 21 or worthing 20 ?
NEG i reckon it should say we should aim to run 7 % slower . me being a bit dense , i never adjust my plans , run at my normal pace & blow up at 18 miles . end up walking & lose half-hour .
POS how do you think you 'd do if you ran it kp ? can you see how you feel later in the week ? choc muffins sound yum !
NEG bowi i am with you about oldies trying to tell you waht they used to do . i qualified for a swimming teacher back in 1981 and a karate -LRB- shotokn -RRB- instructer in 1983 and a gym instructor in 198 4 but would not even think of telling people what to do as things have changes so much each year . how long ago was it that runners had never heard of gels etc .

POS ah - great news re . paris , just need to get your hip sorted out now . at present i plan to do all 3 marathons -LRB- i have done 2 in a month before and felt ok -RRB- - friend did london and stratford last year and he is in his 60s and he managed 4:20 and 3:57 . he ran london with his son and because it was a training run and no pressure , he really enjoyed it . my plan is to treat two of them as training runs and one as a serious pb attempt . on the basis i am not a paula and doubt that i will be digging deep into my last reserves in any of the runs i should be able to recover easily enough -LRB- who am i kidding -RRB- - plodding hippo does them all the time so why not - aim is to get up to 10 and then retire . didds - sorry to hear about your ankle .
POS lol , not a dirty word here today , mr c is currently doing some hoovering EMO_HAPPY i 'm half waving a duster around !

POS jd & rfj - good luck for east hull 20 tomorrow . drk - happy birthday - retirement , that sounds good . am heading for a career break myself , hoping to take a year to 18 months off to spend loads of time with family -LRB- been working away for 5 years -RRB- and put fulfill a few ambitions . i finish mid may and ca n't wait . thinking of triathlon for next challenge as will have the time for more training . lorenzo - sounds like a good race , bet you feelt great passing others in second half . must learn how to do that in the last 6 miles of a marathon - any tips ? 7.5 miles for me this morning with a few sprints mixed in , ready for a long one in the morning .
NEG bootsie , . do n't worry about missing training this late on unless it is because of a medical problem - sorry ankles will clear up and most training now is topping off and contributes to only a small % of your fitness compared to what you have accumulated so far in the bulk of your work .
NEG good lord ! how on earth did people ever manage before gps was invented ! you use the mile markers and a wristwatch !
POS clairster , goes pretty high eh ?
NEU jools , . ok you 're the boss , i 'll be quiet . i just wonder about 10ks and intervals when you 're rehabbing . just been for a hammer on thr bike , round some lanes . it 's a fair effort to average 20 mph esp with that long cllmb out of portsmouth .
POS thanks tu-tu . fantastic running from all 3 cant wait for the stories , awful weather here hope they had it a bit better
NEU so what 's the cut off time ? do they have cut off times for each leg as well ?
POS nice one jools . as has been said you can only beat what is there on the day . echo jap 's comments . few beers and bbq to re-dress the balance this evening . certainly nice about the cooler conditions . got lost across wimbledon common meant only did the 18 and not the 20 i was hoping for . ccnba to add them at the end . . bej - 80 % @ 5.36 is pretty nice . usual run from coro !
POS ah - we fly back tomorrow -LRB- and yes , i might pop along to the club night on tuesday to see about joining -RRB- . it 's been a nice long break but it 'll also be nice to be back home . i might also get to see more of the gb olympic competitors , as they wo n't be featured so much here -LRB- although fortunately they showed the women 's cycle road race so i saw all the 2nd half of it -RRB- . looking forward to watching sailing , rowing and the marathon , plus the odd other highlight .
NEU morning .
POS i thought i might , yes . i have pink cowboy boots !
NEU ive alway use to be a whipper snapper at the short stuff ... in the day i was capable of a sub 5 min mile ! oh how i wish i didnt give up for a few years !!
POS dad of two wrote . hmmm , so the height / weight thing is still going eh ? well , i 'm 5 ' 10 ' and currently 11st 8lb . racing weight last couple of years has been around the 11st mark give or take a lb . i 'm happy with that , and feel a lot stronger and healthier than i did 20 yrs ago when i had a cycle-racing weight of about 9st 4lb -LRB- and i have n't got any taller in the meantime ! -RRB- . i pretty much eat what i want to , and the same with drinking -LRB- i like a snifter now and then , but i 'm not what some would call a big drinker . -RRB- . point is for me that i run to feel good - generally speaking if i run faster i feel better , but if i start to feel that i 'm losing all-round strength or that the end -LRB- feeling good -RRB- is being overtaken by the means -LRB- running faster or losing weight -RRB- then alarm bells start ringing in my head . '' . well we all know my opinion on weight so i 'm not going to dig that lot up again , all i know is , i 'll be running so much quicker it 's untrue when this weight is off . my lungs and legs do n't actually feel too bad considering the lack of training . . but when you 've got 31lbs of flab to lose , that 's alot of minutes for free . doing 3 weight sessions per week , nothing to build any muscle this time around , just for strength and definition as the weight piles off . . actually , tonight is shoulders/arms followed by an 8 miler down the club . . now where 's my lettice leaf ? cheers pug EMO_HAPPY
NEU hi steve , my trainers have done 5-6 hundred miles will it be ok to wear new ones and do you think this might eliminate some of the problems ? fl i 'm not sure what this problem is - it 's hard to say , but i , ll be trying my best to get over it . not sure about running 3 times whilst injured , although i 've had similar type of problem after some marathons in the past -LRB- but i 've always put that down to giving my all during the run -RRB- . i was n't right for new york and should in hindsight have pulled out - but if you go all that way - then you got to run !
NEU barley , . please do n't assign me to a particular group as i wo n't be at mudchute the whole time and will be a roving ff supporter . thanks .

POS i 'd just be interested to know . EMO_HAPPY
NEU i know just what you mean tibby - i 'm following the runners world schedule to the letter t and its killing me watching my running pals -LRB- including my husband ! -RRB- doing longer and faster runs than me . but the tapering is recommended by experts with years of experience so who are we to argue ! last year after a weeks holiday and no running i ran the fastest 10k of my life so there 's something to be said for rested muscles . good luck .
POS hi nemo , hi all . nemo , you 're doing well . apart from a long run at weekends i 'm only managing one other in midweek but at least i 'm doing a long one . i 'm in the nikelondon race on sunday night , wave 3 . look out for me i 'll be in a bright yellow long sleeve t-shirt EMO_HAPPY
POS hi - thanks to all who responded to my comments placed last week - i receive notifications but somehow i can not read your responses - shame as some of the help and advise that i have read sounds to be good . finished silverstone in 2hrs 4mins , improvement of 4 mins on last year - on target at 10miles and even ran with the 9min mile pacer - but from 11 miles seemed to be treading water ... ... missed a number of mile markers so really please when i saw the 13mile marker and managed sprint to line . 20miles in morecambe next week trimpell - so hoping for a 3hr 30min target . will try the flapjack refueling instead of lucazade to see if that aids . well done everyone - keep going - not long to go now . and again apologies for not being able to read your responses . will keep reading the posted comments for ideas and help . take care
POS panties kids were in the bar post flm . they were indeed angelic . i will be there . might not make sense tho . might be nissed
POS tallguy - do n't beat yourself up about it . competing while under the weather is always difficult so sub-2 hours with a bug is not bad at all . welcome back sweep . it 's a shame about your injury a while back but atleast you 've been sensible and have set a lower target that should be more achievable . there 's so many of us with knee injuries on here . prohibition e - is tonight the night when you 're allowing yourself a drink ? open water swimming is n't that scary as long as you 're really slow like me . in last years firth of forth race i had a canoe next to me from about 500m into the race as myself and one other guy were bringing up the rear way adrift of the rest of the masses . it 's a great challenge you should give one a try sometime . just read about your 10k , those km markings were shocking . you may have run a sub-45 race already . cheers for now . ppb .
NEG hi all , just when i had put my thermals away coz the warmer weather had set in i watch the forecast and they tell me there 's gon na be snow by the weekend ! it 's no wonder we 've all had colds , flu , viruses , etc , etc. the wind direction changed suddenly today and the temp dropped 1 or 2 degrees straight away . on top of that i 've now joined the injury list with a severe pain on the ball of my left foot right at the base of my middle toe . feels like i 'm walking on a stone all the time . if anyone has anything similar and a remedy i 'd be grateful . . kattysparke , i 'll be getting to the expo for registration about 11.30 on 13th , comig up from east grinstead . will be travelling up from three bridges on 17th if anyone else travelling up from south wants to meet up . despite injuries and ailments i 'm staying positive about the day and really looking forward to it now . good to see zimchick and paul made the rw column . p.s i know somewhere that hires out walking sticks and zimmers should we require them on the day !!!!
NEU was your number 666 ?
POS could n't agree more . hoorah for um and all the supporters ! boing
POS fabric paint and blue peter it is then !
NEG it 's easy to jump to the wrong conclusions -LRB- as i did -RRB- - it 's been pointed out to me that some runners and marshals sell their medals and jackets , t shirts , caps , jackets etc and donate the proceeds to charity - a club colleague of mine is donating whatever he can get for his staff medal to the dreams come true charity . good for him -LRB- but yah boo to any one who is profiting for themselves -RRB- .
POS legless - thanks . very small field last year was n't it ? that might put me off - do n't really want to be last ! will see how my running goes over the next few weeks . had a lovely relaxing time in your pub yesterday . wanted to get out to lunch but somewhere where i do n't come across people i have barred everywhere i look . your place was ideal .

NEU the future father in law is desperate to get my folks to ` dish the dirt ' ... good lord . we are having an italy paty here tonight cos the boys are all coming round for the football and one of mr kp 's mates grandparents are itailan . tenous but there you are .
NEU ms raptor , best wishes for abingdon . i did my now weekly 13.1 mile solo run yesterday , and was slightly peeved that my pacing -LRB- without technology -RRB- was marginally off and my time was 1hour 47 and not 1:43:30 like last weeks . i guess i 've gotten used to always improving my times , but for a training run , i should be happy that it 's now a regular thing and not a monumental challenge anymore . the plan for glen clova half is to collar someone of experience who has a bleepy thing so i can attack the 100 mins target ! pidge , your photo did n't do you justice either . i had you down as a white van man in his forties ! anyway good luck with barnes green . it should n't be too hot for you ! find someone beforehand who plans a similar pace to you and smash your pb when those gazelle genes kick in from mile 10 onwards !! just do n't bring up your job if you like a chat going round ! ha ! ha ! i am gon na experiment with these wee sis gels that mr dap swears by at glen clova , if it can give me a wee boost to maintain my pace . hrr , i have big plans for you in the winter months ahead , so soak your feet in vinegar like a pair of conkers , and fingers crossed you 'll be back soon . . amanda z , hullo . good luck in stroud . think i 've been there when i lived in bristol . take it easy and think only of good things , never giving negative thoughts any space in your head . . i 've not looked at any training plans yet , feeling that the higher my long run can be come christmas , the better . i 'll have less ground to make up in 2007 , so might actually enjoy it , instead of it being the most hellish 12 or 15 weeks of my life ! qq , does the bloke off blues clues on nick jnr still sing the bedtime business song at 7pm ? a classic ! may have asked this before , but if i 'm 6 ft , 13 stone and have run maybe 500-600 miles this year , is it ok to wait for santa to bring me a new pair of 10 n a halfs ?
NEG given they claim to automatically mail out marathon news to those previously rejected i have a bad feeling about my 5-times-rejected application this year - they 've only mailed it out for past 2 years , had to go looking for it before then . have cheques stubs & bank statements available , plus list of the `` thanks for bequeathing '' gifts - 4 of which are still in use . have never found the helpline all that helpful ; maybe i just get folk who are having a bad day ... ?
NEG good advice to take a mobile with you - mine plays mp3 's and i know i can always use it to call a taxi in case if injury - keep the volume low or you ca n't hear the traffic . . wear something reflective so you can be seen - even with streetlights it amazing how invisible you are without hi-viz gear . and remember , other people are probably more scared of you than you are of them - imagine how you would feel if you were out at night -LRB- walking -RRB- and heard the sound of someone running towards you . the worst i 've had is being egged by a goup of teenage morons from a car ; i was heckled by a group of adolescents once but asked them to run to the top of the hill with me - as you can guess , they all dropped out exhuasted after a couple of hundred yards !!
NEG i 've yet to hit an easy patch in a marathon ! hippo 's spot on with her advice as usual . my big mistake in my first mara was not having carbo loaded enough and i ran out of fuel too early . not pleasant !
NEU reb mm - just want to reinforce what the others are saying . when i did my first marathon training , i ran too soon after having a chest infection and ended up with pneumonia . i ran because i did n't want to put a dent in my training , but ended up writing myself off for weeks afterwards . . that said , i still managed to catch up . you 've still got plenty of weeks to slowly build up the long runs , especially if you 're not going for a particular time . in many ways , your first marathon gives you that extra bit of freedom that you 're going to get a personal best regardless ! good luck .
POS aorn , i hope you 're out there blasting away your hangover now ! good news on your shin , qq :o-RRB- . gentle 5-miler for me this morning too , to find out whether i could run in my new sorbothane insoles . they were fine . i 'm not a morning runner and never really warmed up , but my shin did n't make too much fuss .
NEU < pushes the door open one last time ... > . hi minni - i ran 3:14 at lochaber , which was a pb by 11mins . i use my hrm on every run , although the battery packed up during the marathon itself -LRB- typical ! -RRB- . windsurfin ' susie over on the hard training thread has far more technical hrm training knowledge that i do , so it might be worth sticking your head in there . for me , i religiously kept the vast majority of my runs to 70 % of my working heart rate / 75 % hrmax . i now know what the different efforts feel like and do n't need to check my watch very often . hrm training has certainly improved my sense of pacing . almost always i run by effort and by time on feet , not pace . so for example , my tempo runs include , say , 30mins at 1/2m effort rather than a 1/2m speed . and a typical long run will be something like 2hr30min at 70 % whr , rather than an exact mileage . this approach allowed me to ramp up my mileage to 70-80mpw at peak without injury/overtraining . i ran every day for over 6 months from last september until the taper without problems -LRB- having spent the preceeding 18 weeks off injured and not running at all -RRB- . in the last 4-6 weeks of training i made the switch over to quicker running , trying to hit specific paces , increasing the speed on long runs etc. . which brought me nicely to a peak . i reckon the best thing about an hrm though is on recovery days , where it gives you permission to run slow -LRB- as slow as 10m/m , sometimes even slower -RRB- . i 'm a complete convert to ` active recovery ' now , rather than taking rest days . it 's all useful mileage ! my average pace during the whole training period was only 8.48 m/m . very little speed work at all . but despite this , my eventual marathon pace averaged 7.26 m/m with a slight - ve split . and my 1/2m and 10k times came also improved . hrm training takes patience though . . initially most people have to slow right down and that can be hard psychologically . so it 's not everyone 's idea of fun . but if you 're going to give it a go , i reckon spring/summer 's the perfect time to do it ! a good intro book is ` heart rate monitor training for the compleat idiot ' by john l parker . < closes door on way out >
NEU gobi youda man . without the skinny one with the funny gait to hold you back you 're bound to nail it . have a good weekend kids . as you were then .
NEG unfortunately odeon , 2:59 is n't that impressive for a wheelchair athlete .
NEG ww - sorry about removing you ! on the training plan , i was n't suggesting that would be it for the week , they are just the key sessions i reckon . on the mp training , some of the medium-long run might be at mp and some of the ends of the long runs . i 've never done much mp training , because i find your options are : do 5-6m at mp in a longer run -LRB- which is basically what i suggested above -RRB- . do 10-12m at mp . i find this really hard and can barely manage it without entering a hm race . i usually do this a few weeks before the marathon e.g 5m easy warm-up , straight into the hm at mp . i do n't want to start a fight , but i 'm not a fan of running at mp in training !
POS some great long runs going on . i wish our county xc was on the saturday so i could have bagged one but never mind . had a reasonably good race , came in 8th , but given the opposition i could n't have come any higher up , and would have been very disappointed to come any lower down . there was about a 30s gap in front and behind me , which enabled me to enjoy the last lap a bit more . it was probably the hardest course i 've ever run on - i reckon i was n't faster than 10min/mile up one particular hill , and it was n't that short , and we had to do it three times ! three main hills on each lap , and very muddy for about 50 % of the lap . think we just lost out to coro 's team for the win , but did n't hang around to find out . anyway , a good workout , and i 've been offered a place in the team for the intercounties , so a good afternoon out all in all . coro and edb probably had more interesting races , so i 'll let them recount their tales . ed in particular had a pretty ` eventful ' run ! marders - i 'll be at the fred hughes 10 , but marshalling -LRB- we host the race -RRB- . i think jej said he would be doing it , but that was a while back so may have changed .
NEU ltsa - i think you are spot on , about not getting injured , but pushing you just enough ... ... and of course enjoying the run !! are you used to running that pace ? cause i will need someone to keep me on track , although i will have my trusty -LRB- mostly -RRB- , garmin 305 with me !!
NEU great run benyo - it sounds lovely down there ... ... ... i managed my 16 miles - at least 8 or 9 miles were straight into the teeth of the wind . however , i did n't feel as bad as i thought i would even though uphill into the wind is n't my favourite occupation ! completed in 2hrs 20min so i was really quite pleased as its a hilly route . now i 'm shattered though , so i 'm laid on the couch watching the rugby . . something strange has happend to my left foot ! along the outside edge at the bottom it has developed a big red/black bruise during my run ! did n't hurt as i ran and does n't hurt now ... ... ... anyone any ideas ? i know i 'm overdue for new shoes but keep putting it off as these are like an old pair of slippers now . hope you all enjoy the rest of the weekend - i 'm routing for your mum benyo ... ...
POS geoff m - just read back that you are starting at blue start . think you may be a bit quick for me tho ' ! i 'm going to try and find the sub 4.30 pace maker and stick like glue ! how about you will you pace youself ? EMO_HAPPY
NEU lardarse - are those your legs ? to the question do they look like women 's legs ? my answer is have you met my wife ? you seem to have a thing for shiny medals ! tutu - hopefully swimming and long taper will get rid of whatever it is you have before doctor gets round to finding it . eastham - it was susan who asked if you were lardarse not me . lardarse is on fetch so i know he is not you , and you are n't him
NEG i have a hang over today ... first since my birthday on 2nd january . cant cope with them these days - back on the wagon tonight ... we just had a couple of friends round for a takeaway curry and there was some champers left from people bringing it over post flm and so i set out to drink it . . and then some wine when it was finished ... had a heated argument about ken vs boris for london mayor and woke up feeling like s *** e. EMO_HAPPY
NEG wt - will be thinking of you today . i spoke at my sister ' funeral . i knew i could n't not , and although tough to do , it helped to have happy moments to talk about , and made getting through the day more bearable . i hope you can help give her the send-off she deserved .
NEG same here sb.i think yesterday 's heat surprised a few people , even up here . i did a 10k and found it hard work , then straight to pj 's football match where we found a kid 's triathlon taking place with a cycle course across our pitch . so off to the opposition 's pitch where we got beat 3-1 including a robinsonesque howler from pj . liverpool failed to beat stoke ; chelsea failed to beat man u. after all that , the 10k results were up and on top of being 2 seconds slower than my last race on my watch , they have got me down as 20 seconds slower than my watch time . on the positive-macc half next week , followed by congleton the week after .
NEG it 's tricky is n't it ?
NEG i am following the 3:45 schedule too om but not so rigorously , i am doing lsr , the two longer midweek runs , plus one run with our group , usually a thursday , which is usually 4 or 5 intervals of around a mile and a half but there is dedicated speed session and a hill session too in rotation but i find i have to hold back a little or i get overtired . and i ususally miss the saturday run . so it could be argued that i 'm not really following it at all really ! just back from 7 miles in an easy hour , and off for a shin-saving cold shower before a meal and dvd with mrs puffy .
NEG help , my toenails feel like they are going to fall off - does anyone know what i can do to ease the pain ? the two toes next to my big toe are really sore from the run on sunday , they are not totally black , but sort of brownish and very sore to touch . i have plasters on them to try and cushion from the top of my shoes , but am so worried they are going to drop off . last nights run was agony , not just the toe nails but my heel as well , and i had to keep stopping to stretch out very tight calves . i do n't think my ` free ' sports massage did much good .
POS yes a good thing - the endurance phase is pretty much over now - you have done all the really hard stuff and now can just focus on feeling sharper and getting some speed back into your legs . rest up , stay healthy and look forward to the next 3 weeks and running the best marathon of your life
NEG on the recovery side of things pfitzinger and douglas are very strong about not rushing back : . ` you have little to gain by rushing back into training , and your risk of injury is exceptionally high at this point , owing to the reduced resiliency of your muscles and connective tissue after the marathon . the -LRB- recovery -RRB- schedule starts with 2 days off from running , which is the bare minimum of time away from running you should allow yourself . if you still have acute soreness or tightness so severe that it will alter your form , or if you just do n't feel like running , certainly feel free to take more than 2 days off . if ever there was a time to lose your marathoner 's mind-set , the week after your goal race is it . . not running now will increase your chances of being inspired to resume hard training when your body allows it . of course , some people do n't consider themselves real runners unless they run pretty much every day of their lives . plod through a few miles if you must , but be aware that you 're prolonging your recovery . ' -LRB- p169 -RRB- . p & d do go on to advocate light cross-training such as swimming or cycling and walking .
NEG ironman , . i cant get on your web page , so perhaps it would be better to use the forum .
POS thanks alan for correct flm number . as expected fleece is in the post .
NEG woony , i think eddie was talking about me . i tend to plod behind and looked close to death after 13 last saturday ! sitting here i 'd love to do 18 but will prob change my mind whilst running , especially with those hills .
POS well six of one , half a dozen of the other . i did say that the pace for the get you round group needs to be about about 12 min miles . which if you then take a time based training schedule would give the distance !! in last years ` get you round '' john `` the penquin '' bingham came in at 5hrs 36mins which is approx 12min 45secs / mile
POS had a good 21.5 miles in 2:57 , so feeling good for the day now . one more long run next week , then ease up at last .
POS i will when i move to stourbridge , they sound really friendly . unfortunately , the cardiff club was too fast for me , and think that 12 min miles is walking !
POS jim , i am nervous for all of you lot ... if i do n't see you again jim , good luck and enjoy EMO_HAPPY
NEG batfink , that pit bull passed me as well , lead and all.i was looking for his championchip .
POS for some reason i just thought it would be really funny if paula were to run next year 's london marathon in a womble suit or something . the look on ndereba 's face as she gets beaten by three minutes by a womble would be hilarious . so - what costumer should paula wear ?
NEU will have a look tonight an let you know - nathan just lent about 15 dvd 's to his friend in bristol though so may have a sparse selection ! i have geri yoga if you 'd like to borrow that !
POS swedwr why do n't you think about joining the sunday run from hove too , currently they are doing about 12.5 , all abilities so you would find your pacer easy enough .
POS - race time calculator . - type in your known time for any distance and it will give predicted time for all distances -LRB- provided you do the appropriate training ! -RRB- .
NEG i like doing speed sessions on the tready too - as has been said it pushes you . had my longest run last night , 15 miles , absolute sh1te . the previous long run was 13.5 and i could easily have done another 3 , last night i blew up at 11 and shuffled the last mile in around 11 minutes , which for me is very slow . bollox . hopefully just a temporary set back .
NEG things are n't looking good at the moment . my knee pain is getting a bit worse and i 'm now feeling it after a shorter period of time . i started to feel a bit of pain after just 5 or 6 miles of last nights easy 9.5 miles . i 'll see what happens in my long run this weekend -LRB- 21 miles -RRB- but if it goes badly i may be forced to give up on long runs and just stick with training no longer than 2 hours . i 'll then just `` chance it '' on marathon day . not exactly how i had wanted to prepare .
NEG oops - missed a backslash there ...
POS chuff - i 'd say do your own splits . that way you 've got complete say about how you do .
POS mikeb - top run , well done !! . i was way behind you , but i got a pb by over 8 minutes - finished in 2.43.29 -LRB- on my watch -RRB- . absolutley delighted with that . . started well - was running 6min miles for the first 5 miles and feeling good , but a bit worried i was going too fast . had a bad patch between 10 and 13ish , but got back on track - my legs started to tighten at about 23 , but finished fairly strongly . interested to hear how everyone else got on .
NEU ken - try me at meerkat . freeserve.co.uk
NEG hsbc has n't updated either !!
POS yes , i 'm off this weekend-hurrah ! did a 12.3 miler yesterday and my toes really hurt today and not sure if it 's shoes , sox or just my rubbish running ! think i might struggle on trails as only been doing pavement pounding as training . oh well-it 'll be a laugh ... ... . . for them if not for me !
NEU ran a 17 miler today with my new rubbery but orangey tasting camelpack ... ... the question is ... should i use it on thr flm ??? it must take up valuable time stopping at waterstations as where the pack gives you continuous movement ... the 2 litrses is heavy at first but soon gors ... ???????
POS delia , hopefully will get it all sorted out and it will prove a blessing in disguise for it to have happened now . well done for finishing despite the pain . i 'm sure we 've been told that mental strength is almost more important than physical , and you 've proved yours . what about menu plans for the day before - proven supper dishes to charge us up ?
NEG nowt :--LRB- . diet starts after flm -LRB- carbo loading / stress eating just now ! -RRB- . will be reducing my running and reminding myself that i have blubber for fuel so do not need to replace energy following 3 hrs run cos i wo n't be out for more than 60 mins now -LRB- my family wants mummy back ! -RRB-

NEG obviously that should have read , who actually wants to take part . . actually osd , do n't even bother to defer .
NEU it was my first marathon yesterday and think i entered a fair time on my form -LRB- 5.10 -RRB- and started in pen 9 . i had been warned about congestion in the first 6 miles but there was none - all very civilised and chance to get a good rhythm going . the dodging and weaving came in the last 6 miles when i was getting a rhythm again after a bad patch through 17-20 -LRB- there were bits where you could n't even try to run in the isle of dogs , it was just a stream of walkers -RRB- . perhaps they can put in theoretical slow and fast lanes -LRB- like at swimming pools -RRB- and walkers are obliged to move into the other lane , with some encouragement from the many course marshalls . however , i do know that at 22 miles when you 're tired etc , the last thing you need is some `` police '' telling you what to do . i plodded in at 5.55 , but with a smile on my face .
POS sounds like my kinda town . thanks dustin . can you lend me the money ? - i 'm sure you made enough from kramer v kramer .
NEU i would recommend the white peak , although it is a small race with only 200 runners . you are bussed to the start and run back to cromford along the tiisington and high peak trials -LRB- old railway lines -RRB- . although not hilly , it is n't flat either . first 10 miles are gradually up high , second half downhill , with 3 fairly steep downhills . if you want to do it , you will need to move quickly when the entries open due to the limited numbers that can be accepted . there is also a half marathon which runs over the second half of the marathon course .

NEU jakesy and njord . totally agree with jools b on this and your situation puts everything into perspective does n't it ?! it 's quite easy to get precious sometimes and feel a bit hard done by if you have to run when you 've had a bad day or whatever ... steady undulating 8 miler for me today squeezed in between getting home from work and my little girl 's bathtime . completed in 56:54 which is around 7m 06secs pace and at 65 % whr average . bye for now as off for my tea ! nl
POS just back from picking up my number from the expo . sorry sammy could n't wait til saturday , so i 'll be putting my feet up while you 're standing in the queue . really enjoyed it . got my feet analysed & confirmed that i am a neutral runner which is just as well as i was n't going to change me trainers at this late stage . paul tergat was there but i see he 's dropped out . what with him and paula , if another 30,000 drop out i might be in with a chance .
POS evening all . was planning on a run or two this weekend , or a bit of cycling , but instead opted for a night out clubbing on friday -LRB- we were in the pub by 4.30 pm and home about 2ish ! -RRB- and then spent the rest of the time paying back my other half for her support since january and spending time with the little one doing some nice ` family things ' . do feel totally refreshed however and literally chomping at the bit now , so going to head out tomorrow after work for a 4 miler . sbf - that analysis of results was fantastic , and ashamed to say that somehow the reds did beat the blues :o-LRB- . i uess we all need to keep the momentum going to achieve the goal of sub 4 . last night just before bed i was watching a little bit more of the live flm coverage i sky + ` ed last sunday . is that your first appearance on tv cas ?? EMO_HAPPY that bob the builder costume must have taken a lot of efort to make , it really was quite impressive . afraid i 'm not going to make abingdon , just not practical for me to get there and already have plans for october i 'm afraid . but i will still hang around here for support/banter with my own races if thats ok ? and maybe next year the flm might be in the picture and we will defo have to meet up ? my race plan for the summer looks like this : . 10 mile race may . 10k race june . 10k race july . half marathon august . not sure about sept yet . half marathon october . with the training required i hope to retain/improve overall fitness and improve speed . and lose a bit more weight !
NEU mike - my target marathon pace his year was 7:00 , -LRB- in 2005 it was 7:15 and the wednesday runs were correspondingly slower -RRB- so that 's what i was working up to . sometimes you get carried away and go a little faster . at the start of the build-up they were a little slower , but as your fitness improves they get to 7:00 so in my eyes they were marathon-paced . threshold running would be 6:40 pace for me . and anywya , if i could manage a 20-mile race at 6:45 pace , surely 7:00 pace is ok for those runs ?
NEG checked my barclays account post midnight - nothing gone out .

NEU evening all , . jonny w. was a wizard - i was only 8 mins out ! . therefore if i predict 30-31 mins for my 10k race tomorrow i should be ok . i suppose the folks who went to twickers are still swigging back the sauce somewhere in sarf london . a few approx . stats again then pug . cm . keep on swimming and pj ` ing - look what it did for jonny w. if i have a shit race tomorrow , its been nice knowing you all if only briefly - i 'll be relocating .
NEU cg - its a shame to hear you say `` this thread is a little bit scary '' . if you are aspiring to sub 3:15 then surely this is your thread ? there are a good few on here that are now running sub-3 style mileage and times , probably as a result of training going better than expected , and i hope no-one else has been put off by this or is worrying too much that their mileage/speed is n't up to it ? i know i 've ran 3:06 before off about 40mpw and 7.8 min/mile lsrs , so i figure so can anyone else . anyway after all that rambling i do n't have anything more to say wrt your question that has n't been said above . e.g. , i let my legs chose my sunday lsr pace and it ended up being a lot faster than most training plans would suggest - am yet to find out whether or not that was a stupid thing to do . . was it really worth the risk ? doubt it .

NEU hey pug . sorry to hear about the injury . best advice from me is put all your renowned focus oin to getting it right - do whatever the fizz / sports therapist says - treat the ice / stretch / mobility exercises or whatever as if they are key parts of your training program . then , see how it goes , maybe you could refocus on luton -LRB- 1st weekend in december -RRB- as tipptop suggests , or come down to la rochelle the weekend before with me . even if you do n't get a champs start for london , you will still have a pen 1 green start , and i 'm sure you would n't let a couple of eastenders actresses get in your way ! blisters . judging by the state of worcester city centre today , you 're not wrong about what 'll be with you sunday and monday . - never seen the river so high , and its going to take a while to receed because no matter where you go there are great expanses of water linked to the smallest of streams as the underlying water table has risen so much . managed to find a 7 mile dryish route this evening - would have been a slightly more achilles friendly 6 , but i got stuck on the tow path for a while with canal on one side and flooded road on the other - thankfully it had stopped raining by that point , otherwise i might have been a tad worried !

POS blisters top running , great effort . . the forum shows theres been some good training this weekend . i managed my first ever 18 mile run on sunday , tried to make it slow as recommended , but ran it in 2hr 17 mins -LRB- maybe a bit too fast for 1st time on longest ever run -RRB- . at the end felt tired and realising just how far 26 miles really is . . today i went for what was supposed to be a short slow run with a friend who is also running flm . unfortunately friend is very fast experienced runner -LRB- around 3hr for marathon -RRB- and i wanted to try and keep up . we did 9.3 mile cross country in 1hr 8min felt like nearly tempo pace due to wet boggy ground . i am going to take it slower for rest of week , but feel good -LRB- no aches or pains -RRB- .
NEU lardarse - haile only got to half way last year . be careful copying him ! gels and jelly babies seem identical in content , and i 've used both . for the race last year , i carried a couple of gels but did n't actually use them . the lucozade sport seemed to work fine for me . for training runs , i do n't bother with gels or any food . the idea on long slow runs is to train your body to burn fat and slowly deplete the available muscle glycogen , so i feel it counterproductive to fuel during the run . as for one jelly baby per mile - whatever works for you really . be aware that you will burn 100-150 calories each mile , so any food intake for fuel replacement will make a relatively small impact -LRB- unless you can consume 100 calories per mile , in which case you will struggle to force it down ! -RRB- . timing-wise , the earlier you consume the better . nothing you eat after 18 or so miles will make any difference , as it takes a fair amount of time to metabolise the gel / food . same principle for water - drink early before you are really thirsty , rather than playing catch-up with fluids later in the race .

NEG minni , i 'm the opposite . this morning i was perfectly happy out on the roads on my own , but once i got into the woods i started to get antsy -LRB- possibly because they back onto a fairly dodgy estate though -RRB- . i imagine murderers , rapists and savage dogs around every corner . in fact the dogs are not imagined .
POS m diddy - thats a great 20 miler , well done . went and did the 5 x 1200 session that astride challenged me to , and despite feeling a bit peaky today and yesterday , it went well . after a 2.3 m w/u @ 7:13 , the reps went 4:33 , 4:28 , 4:26 , 4:25 & 4:26 , then 2.3 home @ 7:12 . . i 've lost 6lbs since friday . that ca n't be good , can it ? mind you , i felt quite sprightly and nippy today , so maybe the old body is adapting to the constant instructions being given it ?
