NEG willvill28yes , but facts are irrelevant when dealing with attention whores , religious zealots and bigots.it does not seem to matter that the state department validated his birth record , nor that the state of hawaii has posted a sworn statement vouching for its authenticity.there are people for whom facts are incidental annoyances when compared to the dire importance of skin color and politics .
NEG ugh you 're a mind reader . i wonder what the champions of charity would 've been like had those five crews won instead ...

NEG and did n't capp rather crudely put the moves on her ?
NEG ehhhh ... i think you 're misusing corpus delicti . the corpus delicti is a test to determine if the crime being charged has actually occurred . for example , if we want to charge someone with murder , we have to show there has been a murder first . to do this we use the corpus delicti . you 're trying to use it as a means of defining which actions are crimes . that 's really outside the scope of what the corpus delicti is meant to do . i do n't think any court has actually applied it this way .
NEU i 've played every re game . these movies do the game great justice . they have their own story line sort of . so maybe that 's what people get upset about . but when it comes to some detail like different types of zombies , dogs , gadgets , weapons they 're spot on . the 3d on this movie was amazing and best i 've seen . i feel like it was a lil boring and i hated how it ended . seems like they 're trying to make it more of a story driven action film rather then a story driven horror film which it should be .
NEG tell me you are joking . oh no , you are serious.omg , you actually believe what you are saying . well . good luck to you .

NEU thanks for mirroring.maybe you 'll have more success . 450 views in the last 5 days for my channel.it should have exploded considering it was the only video of othman denying she is `` ambassador to space aliens '' . here 's the thing about this though , she really is `` director '' of `` united nations office for outer space affairs '' so the news reports were essentially correct . they just reported her title incorrectly , which forces othman to deny it.so , did the media do this to discredit the truth ?

NEG you do realize courts do n't recognize sovereign citizenship , right ? so when that creditor sues a sovereign , the court looks at that sovereign as a citizen of the united states , and accountable to its courts . so enjoy ignorance while it lasts .

NEG if you were raised without the ability to question and challenge intelligently what you see on tv , then this video will feel like home . the most dangerous and highly addictive drug on this planet is right there in our sitting rooms . we tune in , open a can of stella and phase out . . the orwellian nightmare is real and the media play a major role . like this video it uses sentimental music , platitudes and solgans to whip up emotions . . and it works . truth is out there if you take the time to look .

NEU what about a situation where in 5 minutse a superintelligent ai helps your consciousness - using the existing atoms in the brain - to convert the matter to a more synthetic substrate , all the while you remain conscious of the situation occurring , and the same pattern exists , just shifted in terms of substrate pattern only . it seems to me massimo does n't want to accept identity can be a digital entity -LRB- therefore copyable -RRB- as much as any computer program is a digital entity .

POS i grew up in boulmer and know main and john really well . remember watching this on tv and it still brings back great memories of being a kid and going down to greet the fishermen as they came home .
POS thanks for the support !
NEG i hate the x factor , the people who go on it have no talent or orininality , they do n't right their own songs , and the only reason that one of them wins is because they have some sob story to try and win the voters over . i bet that he will be working in b & q by about 2013 . simon cowell is not a music fan as all of the people he has helped to create have no talent and last for about a week and a half . simon cowell is killing music and creativity and turning us into zombies by force feeding us shit .

NEG `` where were the suicide pilots from ? where is bin laden from ? where is the wahhabist philosophy that inspires these people from ? '' where are almost all terrorists from ? the middle east , right ? and where are the coalition troops ? the middle east , right ? it 's time you started thinking of the entire area rather then specific countries . the whole place is riddled with nutcases , and with just a little more time and prodding you might have eventually arrived at that conclusion on your own .
NEG smoker - mainland britain consists of england , scotland and wales so it is possible.why did n't bush and blair sort out how to achieve democracy before invading iraq?it could have saved up to 650,000 lives .
NEG hmmm ... the guy who took it with his government is now the number one terrorist . everyone who take these question with the government , hands up on american terror list , just as any anyone who shakes hands with rumsfeld in middle east , becomes a terrorist , a few years later . > > > > so are you saying they 're ` regular ' muslims ?
NEG yes , let 's not forget that there are 2 people on the flight deck on this aircraft and the co-pilot would also have had his hands full doing his part . i get so annoyed when they only ever refer to the ` hero pilot ' . it is remarkable that there were no casualties and for this we must all be very thankful . on a different tack , i can just see the lawyers rubbing their hands in glee for the broken finger nail damages etc. watch this space for the law suits ... ... guaranteed

NEU who ` s got it then ... ?
NEU where did they live ? where i live there 's quite a few people with st georges flag outside the house .
NEG i 'll cancel those binoculars i ordered .
NEU well yes i do . there were many who lived under nazi occupation who strongly supported joe stalin . in occupied holland for example it was the communists who organised the hiding and escape of jews . in britain in 1941 `` uncle joe '' would have come third in a popularity contest behind churchill and king george vi and ahead of roosevelt , who said nice things but had n't actually provided any troops yet . and of course there were millions of decent men and women in the 1920s and 30s who looked to communism as a better way than the economic system they had to live under . so a blanket kneejerk condemnation is simplistic . nice try grant , but that was not the question asked . so - `` you will readily denounce pinochet , somoza the shah of iran - to name but three ? and those who supported them ? '' as to democracy , we can discuss what democracy means after you 've cleared up this little matter .
NEG cheddi on what grounds should israel give up its jewish status just to make the arabs happy . do you think that if jews said we want to all live in saudi arabia so we want it to change its stauts as a muslim state and become a democratic one for all after all the jews are living in the same part of the world are they not just because your naighbor wants something and is using violence to try and get it you should change your national identity to keep the enemy happy either the enemy is willing to accept reality using diplomacy or they want to use violence so you use violence back and crush them but you dont just say i give up i am going to give up my identity so you can be happy . the arabs can give up terror , accept the only option avalible is 2 states based -LRB- not exactly -RRB- on the 1949 ceacefire borders but if they use terror they dont get 2 states and they dont get israel to agree to give up its status as a jewish state . no organistion like the un or country us included can make israel change its stauts its never going to be anything but an arab fantasy

NEU tao , could you explain your comment about my `` special links '' please ?
NEG just seen on tv the results of the latest drone missile strike on `` tribesmen '' . it included some stretcher cases being taken into a hospital . its very interesting to look at the footwear of those on the stretchers . combat boots ?
NEG arafat launched the intifada ? all this youngster ´ s on the streets , brainwashed and `` launched '' by arafat ? isn ´ t it possible that many palestinians ´ s did not get their share of `` peace and security '' and therefore decided to protest against that without permission from arafat ?
NEG i 'm surprised that they found things better in spain and the uk , but there we go . david , as you know , zidane has faced enormous and shameful levels of bigotry in france .
NEU <a href=" "> the idf have finished their report , and have found that there is no way that the idf had any involvement with the explosion on the gaza beach which killed 8 people . will the media publish a retraction of their assumption that israel was responsible ? will hamas apologise for their retaliations ?
NEG `` the nazi 's did n't even want jews as a workforce ... during a war . they wanted all jews dead . quite frankly i doubt you 've ever been to the south because your comments show a lot of ignorance about the region . now if a white person brutally murders a person of any race in any state in the south they are prosecuted and usually sentenced to death '' not usually by any means the number of blacks as opposed to whites sentenced to death even for the same crimes is disproportionate . whenever a shortcomingof the us is ever pointed out its appeasers and defenders always try and justify it by some idiotic reference to conditions in kazakhstan or outer mongolia , as if that is the moral compass . and of course kazahkstan etc do not claim to be paradises of tolerance and human rights . in this case the fact the pupil felt he had to ask permission to sit under a certain tree in his own country is appalling enough . one wonders what similar incidents go unreported . one remembers that wounded black female soldier who openly wondered why her own combat story was soemhow less interesting then the very white jessica lynch . it is also legitimate to ask if other symbols had been hung on the tree would they have equally been dismissed as a `` prank '' .
NEG > but to charge that black victims were deliberately ignored just shows ignorance of the true issues and facts . < that is what most blacks are saying . but of course , whitey knows best in how your n -LRB- word -RRB- feel and think . oh how times have n't changed .
NEG sarah , bush is doing what he does ´ cos : 1 -RRB- oil , nothing new there 2 -RRB- ego , he thinks - like his mum - that he is teh `` choosen '' one russia , china will never go to war with iran ; russia because it doesn ´ t - opposite to the us - want to play a dominate role in the me ; china ; well their old-fashioned ; if they need oil , they just pay for it .
NEG and from the previous week . again - it is ` funny ' that the only time the mods bother to close such threads is when i begin a counter thread on islamic terror ... . evidenced by the fact that i could still post here . dont worry mods - i am going to bother to retrieve more of albert 's spam . the point has been made .
NEG the poem is clearly similar sentiments to those held by jingly . he after all did say that tens of thousands of dead palestinians would n't be such a bad thing . <blockquote class="quotefirst"> <blockquote> <blockquote> <div class="extraquotes"> sick & twisted , boy i wish this board was un modderated .
NEG i think the former british ambassador to the us was probably close to the mark when he said blair was almost drunk with the adulation he recieved in america and his ego was thoroughly massaged . and like all politicians they are obsessed with their so called legacy . he 's got his alright .
POS so which is it ?! democracy or dictatorships or both ?! ----------- both for different reasons .
NEG maybe they did , maybe they did n't quite frankly in the face of the mass aggression of the idf , defacating in palestinian homes , using children as human sheilds , the blatant use of wp as a weapon , rabbi 's telling soldiers they are fighting for god , admitting orders to shooting innocents , orthodox jews , amongst others watching the destruction from the `` hill of shame '' , cheering the kiling of innocents , i think you , * rosie * should hang your little confused flag waving brain out to dry .
NEG that does not excuse the murder of women and children by chemical weapons . do n't forget that iraq started the war by invading kuwait and taking people hostage to use as human shields .
NEG the scots took a bribe to join with england . they valued money over their independence . practical and pragmatic .
NEU can i ask what any of this has to do with `` ugly betty '' or the ugly dog contest ? also you havent answered my question about what exactly you find wrong with the message of `` ugly betty '' - ie its not what you look like on the outside that is important but what you look like on the inside .
NEG / / so now , like muslims , i get accused of moral torpor for failing to state the bleeding obvious . / / well , it would be nice , once in a while , if the obvious were stated . nice identification sense of victimhood , though . / / you have no right to presume that i have no sympathy or concern for victims of rape or sexual assault . / / / / well i 'm not going to say it . / / why , does it require the qualification that other cultures might hold a different view and that we should temper our horror with understanding ?
NEU did i say that martyrdom operations were firework displays ? not even by implication . try again . reach for the skys mate .
NEG wendy as one who condones terrorist acts aropund the world with the flimsiest of excuses about it all being the fault of america , perhaps you could explain to us all why there are now terrorist acxts in india has it become the newest of the united states , without telling anyone is that why terrorists have acted within its boundaries
NEG the united states and germany each played host to mohammed atta . in fact , in the us he enrolled in a military college -LRB- thompson , harpercollins , 2004 -RRB- as did many of his colleagues . britain had allowed haroon rashid aswat to travel undeterred , and even after it was discovered that he had exchanged phone calls with mohammed sidique khan prior to 7/7 , after then moving onto south africa . should these aforementioned countries also experience aerial attacks for allowing these terrorists free movement ?
NEG its true . you are an especially vicious person . oh yes it is you ignorant fool .
NEU relax blobber . saddam 's dead , stop worrying.he ca n't harm you anymore . could n't harm me anyway , he was a sad old pensioner .
NEU shows what a diverse and open society it is . there 's a little bit of every arab country in israel aswell . makes you proud douse n't it ? tell us about citizenship rights in the arab or muslim world .
NEU / / swimmer michael phelps was the ` man of the games ' . / / `` well , how can he not be , with 8 golds and 6 wrs ... ?!! usain bolt was a mere bagatelle compared with that . '' phelps is the best swimmer in the world but usain bolt 's finish in the 100m will live long in the memory , just as bob beamon 's incredible leap did in 1968 . running is superior to swimming because humans can run faster than they can swim.if phelps could swim 100m in less than 9.69 seconds then he 'd be better than bolt .
NEG how about ignoring them because the president of argentina is not a crazy religious nutcase , and argentina , unlike iran , is an ally of the us ? tony , sometimes i wonder if you 're a few fruitcakes short of a lib-dem party conference !
NEU simcha 1 -RRB- can you tell me where are the israeli soilders in iraq and afghanistan < < < mossad is behind them all . 2 -RRB- there is no such place as palestine this name the romans gave to the kingdom of israel < < < it costs you nothing to dream in those ancient and vanished days ! wake up ! we are living in 2006 and not 2 thousand years back !!!!
NEG there does n't seem to be anything to disagree with unless i can be bothered to do research of my own . the figures about ricketts are interesting , i believe the problem is that there is hardly any vitamin d in a diet from the sub-continent , the inhabitants getting all they need from the sunlight . consequently if you do not adjust your diet accordingly you will suffer . all the conclusions drawn from the information are surely hypothetical and i am afraid i can not really be to get involved in nit-picking about the conclusions .
NEG suicide rates among us soldiers are heading for a record high.eighty-nine suicides were confirmed in 2007 . army suicide rates have risen coinciding with the us-led military action in iraq and afghanistan . spending a lot of time in stressful war zones is not good for mental health . <a href=" "> news.bbc.co.uk / 2/hi / ... </a>
POS i thought there would n't be any more starwars sequels or pre-quels . lol . how about instead of starwars , we just do starbucks ? oh wait , that 's already done .
NEG oh well that 's the best way . get the troops that saved your neck close to children and blow them all up . of course you could make the children suicide bombers like they did in israel . sort of kill two birds with stone because you could still blame the americans . yep . i 'm convinced islam is a religion of peace . a long peace for anybody who they do n't like .
NEG and why should n't they scream blue murder ? when you see jacka $ $ es like bush spew out invectives about us being a shining light for freedom across the globe and then falls way short of those ideals , should n't people speak up ? you obviously wont .
NEG the irony of it all is that whilst the west looks to impose democracy on the east by bringing it out from its draconian measues and social systems , it itself is pushing through legislation which is considered draconian and is vehemently opposed by all human rights and freedom of speech groups . somebody obviously seems to have come to a conclusion that there is only one system of social administration that is acceptable and that the both east and west arent there yet . surely the land and its people should have the right to decide what laws they wish to govern their land by and if so let the muslims lands follow shariah law and let america follow democracy . why the constant to force others to do how you want them to behave . and can the anti-islamists please not jump on this and say that it is the muslims who impose themselves on the west as we that response is getting ridiculous .
NEG hey - i thought you were on the side of the sunni supereamists - the ones that also want to wipe the shia off the face of the earth . how come you are popping up here defending the mad leader of iran ? is it in the hope that he will lead his innocent people into destruction ?
NEG as long as the cigar man clinton does not get the slot . not that mr.annon has any intention of stepping down .
NEG they do n't have the mental stamina to play a game over five days , or the alcohol tolerance to sit and watch for so long whilst drinking continuously
NEG the report has not been released yet , so i wonder if you know if you need to attack it yet ? . .
NEG hitler you claim loathed it though it served his needs in the vatican but we have to accept plenty of christians joined hitler in his ` crusade ' and we should not forget the jewish collaborators . `` fripono you really hav n't got a clue , have you , azania ? hitler loathed the christian church . it was tolerated , as long as clergy toed the national socialist party line . any clergy -LRB- such as the courageous bonhoeffer -RRB- who criticised nazism were persecuted . a great many were executed . ''
NEG interesting that it is the ex-pat vote that will probably turn this one around . are they all berlusconi refugees -LRB- possibly - i 'd have got out as quick as i could out of sheer embarrassment -RRB- or are they the sort who could n't care less what sort of chaos the old country goes through once they have pulled their own ladder up ?
NEU of civilization nows supplies the world with cab drivers .
POS give it time .
NEG is the brown recluse in europe ? now that is a nasty little spider . not sure which is worse the poison it has that can eat away your flesh or a plain killing poison of the widow . both can outright cause death , but that flesh eating property of the recluse ... ugg .
NEU actually its not just 72 virgins , but the actual quote from the koran -LRB- chapter 56:17 -23 and 76:19 -RRB- also adds unlimited catamites . this puts an interesting spin on the islamic view of homosexulity .
NEU why then post the following : message 66 - posted by colonelartist ** , 20 minutes ago and if i were on the plane i would have negotiated a deal with the hijackers , given a factual report of what was going on the plane and whereabouts of the two pilots , and would have kept an eye on the f16s . and its only obvious to the assumptions of those who assume that plane was on its way to kill more people .
NEG was there any other evidence other than his confession ? the report does n't make it clear .
NEG again with the paternalism . venezuelans , cute little beach combing , coffee drinking , mango eating people that they are just can not make decisions like launching a coup without the serious leadership from the us . there is absolutely no proof the us was involved in the very poorly organized coup . chavez spouts on about it to distract the world from the fact he is slowly tearing down every vestige of democracy in that oil rich nation .
NEG `` i do n't think you got my point grant , the japanese people who are still alive and who remember the nuclear bomb which was dropped , actually are worried about the us not iran . '' for all that some japanese still resent -LRB- probably justifiably -RRB- the actions of the us at the end of the second world war , i 'm not sure there is widespread -LRB- if any -RRB- worry about the us militarily at the moment -LRB- for obvious reasons -RRB- . there are worries about north korea and to a certai extent russia , but i 'd be interested to hear where you got the idea that they are worried about the us ?
NEG yep the whole world is going down the pan
NEG the story illustrates the futility of paying ransomes for kidnappings , as it only encourages more listen to the talibans response to a previous deal
NEG fair enough . i think the bbc wanted an actual debate , with real facts and stuff , but that 's ok . if the idea is just to make up the most vicious racial and religious hatred , then lets go for it . i 'll start . could one of the scholars of arabic culture on the board explain to the rest of us what the old arab proverb `` a woman for duty , a boy for pleasure , a melon for ecstasy '' means ? is it based on something in koran ?
NEG answer me why was it allowed to happen ? how come `` the allies '' as you call them have not been vocal ? i have n't seen bliar on tv talking about this torture that has been going on uder their watch . i have n't heard the `` cretin '' rail against it either . why the deafening silence ? it shows the duplicity of `` the allies '' .
NEG who would the `` usual subjects '' be then ? what name calling ?
NEG both sides are totally out of control . we need a de-militarised zone controlled by the un . israel is now an aperthied state with pass laws and palestine is in the hands of islamofascists , it 's a total mess .
NEG france did n't become the 4th largest economy on earth by playing fair !
NEG sunnis and shias ca n't even live in peace in a one nation iraq !!!
NEG you can here them in the vatican going , `` see i told you so ! and you wanted birth control ! ''
NEG i do not see how a single poor lawyer in a nation of 296 million people can effectively discredit its entire legal system . you do not even say how the judge and the jury in this case reacted to the statement .
NEU what , you mean as opposed to have been led by the same family for the better part of a millenia ?
NEG wendyman oh i see . so if i put a sword to your head and ask you if you 'd like to either convert or have your head chopped off you 'd be making a free choice ? thanks for making that clear .
NEU northern ireland or bask regions would be more appropriate examples . i do n't agree that `` the central government is obliged to grant a degree of autonomy - or in the last resort let it go '' to any group that requires so .
NEG i think we can all agree that it is israel and it 's supporters who have a problem with the facts , as we have all seen on these mb 's . and rejecting terroism does not upset me at all . i think we all should , where ever it comes from . however. , what i find rather ironic is this same person would have been called a terrorist by that same judafacist mouth piece , only last week . but today , he is some they can use for thier propaganda .
NEG the joint-authors of that recent paper that criticised israel , they couldnt find a publisher in usa for their paper . had to use a british publisher . the big donator of the belfer chair -LRB- one of the professors chairs -RRB- is an american jew who ran exxon or whatever . he has phoned to insist no publicity with his uni position is used in the promotion of the paper .
NEG really odd . i 'm sure he/she/it slipped up a while back and said they were in pakistan . do we know what part of scandanavia it is ?
NEG o true believers , contract not an intimate friendship with any besides yourselves : they will not fail to corrupt you . they wish for that which may cause you to perish : their hatred hath already appeared from out of their mouths ; but what their breasts conceal is yet more inveterate . we have already shown you signs of their ill will towards you , if ye understand . '' -LRB- the family of imran - verse 118 -RRB- . '' look around you , whichever muslim country contact the west , it is doomed ... their wish to is that muslims just perish ... its so ovbious ... . the signs were shown and the signs are still shown ...
NEG `` he will be blaming him for the death of the dinosaurs next . '' you mean the dinosaurs are dead , all of them ? cheney probably shot them .
NEU manchester me , > > > if we europeans can be big enough to stand up and make ourselves heard in the face of wrongdoing , what is your excuse ? < < < that 's just the point : can you ?
NEG in the fifties and installed the puppet shah with help of stormin normans daddy ... schwartskopf senior . cia and sis inspired `` communist '' infiltrators financed by britain and usa were used as an excuse to depose the democratic govt of mossadeq has the time come for the west to resort to similar tactics . ? would they succeed today ? will israel be used by the west to deliver the hammer blow to irans nuclear plans ? sfc so many questions . . bird flu as well ...
NEG i believe he 's on his way to washington for a chat before heading to barbados for a well earned rest . hopefully he might have a word with dubya concerning the use of prestwick airport as a stop off for israel-bound weapons . it does n't really send the right message when a country can provide both humanitarian aid for the lebanese people , and a resting point for the bombs that will probably blast them into next year .
POS hillary has a long history of supporting women and children 's rights . she has a long history of supporting a woman 's right to choose . she has been a longtime advocate of universal healthcare and has a longtime committment to civil rights . i think these things are illustrative of some inner convictions . as for obama , i 'm not sure we really know enough about him yet . he does seem dedicated to public service however , giving up the chance to work on wall street to community organize in chicago . he 's also been consistently pro-choice , pro-gay rights . mitt romney changed his views on gay rights , abortion , gun control and immigration just in time to run for the republican nomination . all politicians change from time to time , evolve their positions and take account of changing circumstances . however the sheer brazeness of romney 's flip flopping was something to behold .
POS very true itstoppedraining . but i guess you would not remove their right to choose , just because they made a choice you did n't like ? andy
POS mind you that was ` cos they all fancied you .
POS `` see how well we 're getting on and all you had to do was remove your army from my country ! a lesson there i think '' whatever country you are in ... im sure china will rush to your side should you ever need assistance . same with food and medicine . dont forget we are stopping all aid too , in this little scenario .
NEG yes . that baffles me , too . i can only suppose it 's something personal - between the usa and castro . seems a bit petty .
NEU try telling that to the irish .
NEG ` it 's all very well sitting in a comfortable middle class existence in surbiton and criticizing the slow extinction of what is actually a competitor with human beings ' a very narrow view . ecosystem health is the sign of a healthy plant . life is more than a utilitarian batttle for survival .
NEG `` i like a good scrap as much as anybody but i 'm damned if i want my country to be your bitch , so i suggest you go it alone on a few wars and see how it goes while we save a few quid for a change . you owe us a lot of blood and i 'm not too worried about you paying up '' . well you 've got your chance to go it alone against the iranians , big ob , but my feeling is you 'll continue the ` diplomacy ' angle until the americans take charge . the americans owe you a lot of blood ?? you must be another one of those goofy brits born after 1970 who have never heard of world wars l or ll , or the hundreds of thousands of americans buried in european graves . for years europeans have been whining about the americans claiming they won these wars exclusively , a lie but who cares . now the europeans are in one minor skirmish , with the americans forming the major thrust , and they 're already crying about `` you owe us a lot of blood '' . what a bunch of immature babies you 've become . the women over there have more balls than you , and the iranians certainly know it .
NEG i think kasparov was done.but it was only a matter of time before computers win.they will take over the world some day.i 'm off to the moon when that happens .
NEG its only logical that diplomats should have imunity they are after all not there as individuals they are their to represent their countries government how can you expect politcal business to take place if the diplomats are scared to go to meetings abroad your going to limit diplomacy to the telephone . diplomats are already exempt from customs checks , their lugage can not be searched , they can carry weapons or have armed gaurds so they are not like ordinary individuals . what would happen if somebody in maybe france or russia managed to get a judge to issue a warrnet for the arrest of bush and blair because they belived that what happened in iraq was war crimes what would happen 2 of the most powerfull men in the world couldnt go to france or russia to discuss diplomatic business private individuals fine issue warents and they can be arrested no get out clause but if your talking about diplomats your getting inton dangerous territory .
NEG ' a hamas minefield ! can you prove that it was an israeli miss or that there was any intention to murder anyone ? ' rubbu ish the bbc were there and they incident was reported extensively and investigated by the un . + + + + + + big deal !!!! now , did the bbc say that it was an israeli missile that killed people on the beach ? no ! all they reported was that it was a claim by the palestinians and refuted by israel . same thing with un . in fact un did not investigate it . it was a human rights activist . you ca n't even get basic facts right !!! i am not sure i can believe any of your claims . `` last time i looked in gaza water is still being redirected away from palestinian territories '' + + + + + last time we all looked at the photos of lauren booth in gaza we saw the moist amazing , well-watered lush , green , abundant gardens . where did that water come from again ?
NEG < < < < does oil mix with water even though you stir them continously > > > > oh yeah , the racist bnp type analogies start coming out now . whats next ? `` is a dog born in a stable , a horse ? '' blah blah blah ...
NEG probably by annexing a large chunk of the west bank and redesignating most of jerusalem as a jewish city and evicting the arabs from those districts . would any sensible arab trust the present israeli leadership ?
NEG not at all . read my previous posts in this thread to see at what i was actually alluding .
NEG who said the war was about oil ? the lonney-left , not bush . who said that it was fought in the name of christianity ? the looney-left , not bush . etc , etc , etc. .
NEG as a photographer i 'm very much aware that most images in the media have been paid for . is it known if nbc are taking payment from printed media and tv companies for the video and photos ?
NEG about the emigration of jewish people from europe to british mandated palestine after ww2 . it was british policy to restrict that emigration , and some 49 ships carrying 66,000 jewish people were boarded by the royal navy , and the passengers taken to internment camps on cyprus . <a href=" ">
NEG grant , the point is i have n't had an answer . you declined to talk about the spanish civil war when i had n't even asked you to . i asked you to comment on the us entering into a military alliance with fascist spain in the early 50s . in fact in summarising our debate over mc carthyism it is clear that your argument is hypocritical and full of holes . you 've made a statement along the lines of , ` we should be vigilant against fascism and communism ' . well the us govt . certainly was n't . i 've already pointed that the the us admin . worked with fascists in greece , italy and spain -LRB- as well as a host of murderous dictatorial regimes across the globe -RRB- . yet you build an argument around the need to protect ` freedom ' . this is utterly hypocritical . the us , during the mc carthy period was hounding people they believed were communists , or used to be , or knew somebody who was , or thought they knew somebody or was etc etc. all in the name of ` freedom ' . but who were the kind of people being hounded ? i would never join the chat post but am more than aware of how many of their members have rallied to progressiove causes . in britain who was it who stood in the front line when the british union of fascists tried to drive out the jews ? the cp . and who was it who fought against and suffered under the nazis in germany ? and what would nelson mandela say ? imprisoned for 27 years , who was it in the front line against the vile apartheid regime ? the cp . whilst the us on the other hand were happy to work with the regime in the military conflict in angola . the truth is mc carthyism has nothing to do with preventing mass murder by stalinism and everything to do with denying freedom in the us itself . you say you are for trade union freedom but mc carthyism amounted to hounding union officials out of jobs and sacking people for not signing ` loyalty oaths ' . the kind of unionism you favour is compliant unionism , the tame variety that does fight for members interests . this is what mc carthyism was all about . talking about freedom whilst dealing with fascists . hounding people who the most likely to rally for freedom of black people in the usa and south africa . a final point about islam . again you spout hypocrisy on this issue . for years the us has used saudi arabia as a client state in its dealings in the oil rich middle east . yet this alliance has spawned the likes of bin laden , the irony is presumably lost on you . so let 's have no more of this hypocritical posturing on the need to fight for freedom .
NEG sorry , i meant septmeber 11th . then the bali attacks were on october 12th . ca n't see a pattern ?! i 'll spell it out for you 1 year later 1 month later 1 day later
NEG the people are not interested in education ? that 's what i would expect someone who ` thinks ' a religion is a substitute for an ` education ' would say . it is not , and it never has been . this is an identity that your country has n't even been able to deduce for itself , so again colonelartist , you are just over projecting too . let 's just assume you are right , and these poor little country bumpkins have no ambitions in life beyond their stations as peasants -LRB- abhorrent and wrong - but an assumption none the less -RRB- . this is dear to you , the thought of simplicity , the thought of ` nothing do ... ing ' , and the thought of not having opportunities presented and within arms reach of people . you would force them onto this path , you would keep them on it , warning them of the dangers that await them should they be tempted by satan and all his devices -LRB- like i said , religion is n't an education -RRB- . fine ! have it your way . but we 'll still build that road . we 'll still build that school , and we 'll still pipe in that water and deliver sanitation . and when it 's within arms reach - they 'll take that road whether you like it or not colonelartist . you did , and you probably rail at that personal choice you made in your live -LRB- feeling it 's a dishonour to your simple view of islam -RRB- . but do n't presume that others share your spirits or tempers . quite simply - you ca n't stop it . more and more and more educated women are coming to wider islam , and more and more and more of them will be offered the chances to stop acting like the `` oppressed '' . and when those coins begin to drop everywhere , the grip of religious extremism is loosened never to return to total control and domination , which is all it 's really concerned about anyway . your sense ` norm ' is well understood by us , and the thing about it - it 's old , it 's out of date , it 's retiring . i 'll give it 50 years max . say bye , bye now ...
NEG russia is courting the me governments with the idea of forming a natural gas cartel , similar to opec . `` european union leaders have said they would stand against any effort by russia to create such a cartel , fearing gas prices -- and russia 's political clout -- could rise dramatically as a result . europe gets 44 percent of its natural gas imports from russia . '' <a href=" "> with russia already supplying nuclear technology / arms to iran and others in the me could this be ` the deal with the devil '' that putin is looking for . control of natural gas would cripple europe .
NEG everything is the fault of `` the west '' and america according to some . saddam is in power committing mass geoncide - the wests fault saddam is removed from power and muslims start killing each other in widespread sectarian violence - the wests fault ca n't the islamic world do anything for themselves ? ------------------------------------------------- everything is the west faults , you are right . mass genocide ? which mass genocides ? all that he was hanged for was killing of 148 shias ... the rest is all a myth ... since he wasnt put on trial for those so called mass genocides ... maybe the west realised that they didnt after all have any evidence , or the evidence they had for those so called mass genocide was as wrong as the evidece of wmd ... you are left with speculations now , and speculations are just speculations ... and the benefit of the doubt goes to sadam since unlike his invaders he didnt lie ...
NEG how dare we vote for them ! i mean , what kind of countries are these ? democracies ? perhaps we should all vote for who the left tells us to !
NEG johnny m and gavinuk2 , perhaps you could explain a couple of points . if nazism was socialist why was hitler financed by capitalists and why was pre-hitler germany characterised by battles between nazis and communists ? and why were socialists and communists rounded up by hitler , thereby becoming his first victims ? and why did stalin attempt to annhialate any bolshevik who participated in the 1917 revolution ? in other words why was the stalinist model , later copied by other states , built upon brutal repression of socialists ? ps . have noted two long contributions , fec and gavin , will try to read later .
NEG `` not nearly as likely in the uk as the u.s. , '' according to you , you still have n't posted those percentages . now you are comparing all crimes , again with no figures cited .
NEG shy talk - and so you thought < < `` arab denoted race and `` palestinians '' denoted nationality . sorry they are arabs and not yet a nation .
NEG / / what do you know about dresden ? / / it may have been unecessary as the war was more or less won.there is no equivalence here as the palestinians are still fighting for their survival .

, where are they now ? . and what evidence do can you adduce to support the claims of whosoever you bring forward in support of your argument ? . < < once again , do you have the same theories about every piece of land ? who is the true owner of england ; saxon ? dane ? celt ? -LRB- this is very bad news for most of the people who think they are citizens of a country like the usa -RRB- > > what are my ` theories about every piece of land ' ? . i am talking about people . people have connections with with geographic regions . < < i thought you were saying that as long as you could keep palestinians off their land until the first generation were all dead then that would make their dispossession acceptable . i do not think that is the right way to treat anyone ; armenian , jew or palestinian . > > it would help if you read what i actually wrote and then consequent upon digestion thereof you responded with your opinion . i pointed out that most ` palestinians ' who were alive in 1947 are now no longer alive . even if they were born in 1947 they would now be 61 . the vast majority of the palestinians were born post 1947 . this is a simple fact . so now , on what basis do you advance the notion that they have the right to go and live in the state of israel ? . pay close attention to the last three words . state of israel . nine syllables.concatenate . aspirate.appreciate . < < first of all nowhere did i say that if you can displace ' a population ' for long enough then it does not matter , and i challenge you to either point where i said as much or withdrw that remark . . > > you then go on to quote two paragraphs from my previous post that do not in any way substantiate or even speak to the idea that ` it does not matter ' . in fact if you go back and read my posts you will find that i am sympathetic to palestinian aspirations towards statehood . < < i do not know why i am finding it so hard to explain that i find all this talk of who is or is n't a ` people ' both absurd and sinister . we should treat people as individuals - when considering the right way to treat a fellow british person is i do not first need to find out if they are a jew ! similarly , states have a duty to displaced persons ; their ` people ' is irrelevant . > > and i on the other hand am quite astonished at your ` difficulty ' . it seem to me that you are taking great pains to deny the existence of the fundamental anthropological imperative to form cultures . yes of course we should and do treat people as individuals.but your next statement is at once problematic yet informative . and belies a smidgeon of arrogance on your part . you have a world view.it is your world view.if you do not consider the individual as he has self defined himself you have abrogated to ourself the right to impose a world view upon him because without consideration to the way he has self defined himself all mutual interaction has to be based upon your world view . i love pork crackling . they are cheap and the after taste hangs around for longer than a packet of crisps . i always have some on me.i never offer them to my son 's somali team-mate . and condiderate englishmen do n't indulge in conversations centred around the derring-do of british bomber pilots in front of germans . i would hope that you transact with other people with a bit more sensitivity . < < so your difference with the bnp is that they are interested in ` race ' and you are interested in something called ` self-identity ' > > i am not ` interested ' in self identity . it exists.it is . < < actually , the mainstream bnp tend to use your approach these days . they deny their dislike of immigrants is about racism - it is all about ` shared values ' and ` britishness ' . > > the bnp can use whatever disengenous ` approach ' they like to camouflage the fact that their ideals are racist . however ` shared values ' and ` britishness ' are quite correctly mainstream concepts and are incorporated into both labour and conservative party policies . < < no , it 's not up to them . it is up to all of us to fight against that sort of behaviour . > . again , you arrogant slip is showing . on what basis do you abrogate to yourself the right to decide how others view themselves , their history , their heritage , their norms and who others wish or do not wish to associate with . i am quite franjly astonished at your arrogance . would you then take issue with nelson mandela then when he offered afrikaaners the option of constitutionally negotiating for an afrikaaner homeland . ? < < you are free to associate for your mutual benefit but only up to the point where it infringes on the rights of other groups to equal treatment . do i really need to tell you this ? > > no what you do need to do is explain yourself . freedom of association is just that.freedom of association . hotmousemat i really think that you need to step back and think about all of the contradictions in your arguments . just by way of example : -- 1 . you tell me that you have great difficulty in underestanding the notion of ' a people ' .2 . then in one of your other posts , unrelated to our discussion , you write '' < < but when we see a people behaving in a way that seems unreasonable it is as well to try to understand how it may seem from their point of view . > > -LRB- my caps -RRB- . so maybe your ` difficulty is a contrived ` difficulty ' . no ? .
POS quite right
NEG jla watch , another fun-filled rant . / / / / / they wo n't also stand for human rights either . / / / / likud do stand for the rights of humans . / / / / they stand for the rule of force - a policy that has failed israel ever since its foundation - as it has generally failed every other country which has tried it / / / / you 'll be rooting for likud because you would like israel to fail . have you ever thought about reading a post and thinking about it before responding ?
NEG that 's why bush 's ` war on terror ' is barmy.anyone he does n't like is branded a ` terrorist ' or ` terrorist sympathiser ' . condaleeza rice has been saying some nutty things about hugo chavez -LRB- venezuela -RRB- recently .
NEU rosie i refer you back to the link i posted in message 4 . whats your views on that ?
NEG somehow i doubt it . i doubt these people could read russian or hebrew , let alone arabic . they 're not going to get any help from hamas , not least because by the nazi definition , whether they like it or not , they are jewish themselves .
NEU hi sergeant pluck , sergeant pluck quote : `` why not just invade another few countries and steal all their oil ? simple , eh ? '' i am sitting in the middle east trading oil and do n't understand how the us has stolen any oil so why do n't you explain the heist to us all . come on i really want to hear the nuts and bolts logic behind how you can imply such . warmest regards , smoker
NEG mondial , the tragedy of iraq is that the majority of the killing of people is done by fellow iraqis , not the us/uk occupiers . much was made of the shock and awe bombing campaign . however , this was not wwii style carpet bombing of cities with hundreds of planes . precision bombing of military targets means vast blocks of cities are n't taken out just to hit one target . fellow iraqis are bombing markets , football celebrations , mosques , etc. , all deliberate civilian killing . please do n't believe i supported this invasion for one minute . it was a disaster and unnecessary from the beginning . with that said , iraq pales in comparison to the ` genocide ' in sudan . is it that the us/uk are involved that makes it worse to some ? i do n't see how one or two bombs used selectively is any worse than the 20 million killed each by stalin or mao . then there 's the killing fields of cambodia , rwanda in the 90s , etc. .
NEU you have to bring islaam into everything dont you ?? is islaam that great that you always have to mention it ? lol .
NEU it has to be good news if there are signs of turkey throwing off the shackles of islamofascism . 1,000,000 + turks marching to support secularism and democracy - now that 's goping to have the hard euro-left sobbing into their copies of das kapital !
NEG the holocaust is a tragedy . the statistics show that approx 6 million were murdered . i 'm sorry if this confuses you .
NEG india is the most fanatically religious country in the whole world . religion oozes out of every nook and corner of india , and i am not talking about the cows that roam around freedly in the streets .
NEU zarqawi 's victims did have a trial of the same sort wallace had .
NEG how can justice be served ? > > > > it already has been served . people who participate in this kind of barbarity are sub human , and will never know the joys of those who have evolved . every day they wake up in the same twisted & perverse reality . the obvious answer of how to prevent them from imposing their insanity on to others , is to lock them away .
NEU sun , 13 jul 2008 16:33 gmt , in reply to imspartacus in message 4 i 've just looked up and i ca n't see any strings ...
NEG to nighthook - sorry to tell you that if you can not read , then it be not i to teach you.the discovery was not of / / a few plants / / -LSB- !!! -RSB- but of a most interesting scientific discovery of some ancient invertebrate sea creatures ... and as britan 's nafthe institute has decided to boycott israeli universities and educational academies , then it would be justified that nafthe be exempt from sharing in any further knowledge relating to this hugely interesting scientific discovery - the boycott by nafthe having been influenced by the palestinians themselves ... !
NEG and all that from those who in the 1960 's , 1970 's demonstrated calling for military intervention against what was then called '' the evil whites '' of rhodesia . did they not warn britain and the world what would happen if mugabe and his cronies were in power .
NEG after what has happened recently , they were bloody stupid to do what they did ! they should have respected the laws of the land !
NEG agreed , clinton , way too much baggage and a husband with direct link to the white house , very odd dynamic .
NEU if the palestinian/arabs have any sense in their heads , they will pray and hope for another like arik sharon who will give them ` land for peace ' . sharon did just that - but what peace did he get for his country ... . . ` o ' . afraid the palestinian/arabs are going to have ` hard times ' from now on ... . .
NEG er , no but you always assume colonel that you know what people are , you have been bleating for months about how i am british which i 'm not so dont assume things which you cant tell ...
NEG `` what planet are you on ?????? you dont count the umproviked rocket attacks by hammas on israel as breaking the ceasefire then ??? thats ok in your eyes , israel had approx 6 months of this before they did something . so tell us again who broke the ceasefire '' read this and then apologize and admit you were wrong and uninformed . <a href=" ">
NEG well as you 've run away from actually arguing your case and have replaced it with stock insults it is getting very easy for us . no wonder you regard john wayne as a hero , he must seem a towering intellectual to you and granty .
NEG agreed . consolidation in a shrinking market generally is the best way to go . therein lies the problem for both stella and bud . in europe , the traditional ales are rebounding . in the us , local upstarts making product sometimes near as good as their european counterparts have been steadily grabbing market share from the big brewers . they will not go away altogether . but in the future they will not be what they were .
NEG simcha2 - millions of people died in a terrifying manner and many others survived terrifying ordeals other than jews in ww2.the russians lost 20m in all.what do you think it must have been like for the survivors of attacks like nagasaki or hiroshima?anyway even irving is not denying the holocaust any more.he agrees millions died .
NEG the really surprising thing about this story is that is n't that surprising . we 've all known for a long time now that bush repeatedly lied/misled/twisted the truth whatever you want to call it . i 'd say this was the final nail in the coffin of bush 's reputation but that nail went in a long time ago .
NEU how would you have stopped it ?
NEG mistress you have muslim neighbours . i find that very hard to believe . how do you manage to live there ? no one finds the sight of a woman vulgar unless you are trying to tell us something about yourself . it would n't surpirse me because you come across as a vulgar and vile woman anyway . muslims love women and treat them with the respect that they deserve . something you obviously would know nothing about .
NEU sorry ruth , i was n't responding to you but to post 39 from insultan . ` groover ' is just my favoured term of casual address . i think the fact that i was responding to another post led to confusion as to meaning ? i think there is a place for opinion and comment within the wider news . however , i think it must be clearly authored and distinct from ` straight news ' , as it were . i think it 's only a problem when news organisations ` editorialise ' instead of reporting . as to theorising , maybe i do have a theory . yippee ! however , the basis of my theory is that the actions of any power when in conflict with a party demonstrably ` weaker ' -LRB- in conventional terms -RRB- are subject to greater scrutiny and criticism than those of their opponent -LRB- for all the reasons gone over before -RRB- . as to terrorism itself being inevitable in a given situation - yes and no . i can empaphise with what might lead someone to the conclusion that such might be their preferred option but -LRB- remarkable as it seems -RRB- this is not an inevitability it is a choice -LRB- see tibet -RRB- . lizards from space , are these the same lizards who are behind the international money markets and the re-branding of consumer brands ? you 're theory is gaining weight .
NEG `` is n't it a petty thing to have a go at him for ? '' perhaps . but i would n't set myself up by trying to defend him either . when someone enjoys the sound of their own voice as much as does bho , odds are there 'll be the occasional self important silliness . best we laugh at this guy now rather than have foreign leaders laughing at him later . i know you want us to be gentle on him but why ? this is quite probably the most important job in the world and you want to give him a pass ?
NEG hey zabacs , > > yeah , thats what i thought regarding muslim world . i mean , western europe , sorry for mis-spelling . < < no need to apologise zabacs , it is an understandable mistake to make , and the worst you can be accused of is forward thinking . > > yet , property could do fine around here . no muslims around , and , if eu breaks down before blood in streets in muslim-controlled euarabia countries ... < < what do you think will happen to eastern europe when western europe collapses into another of the long nights of bloodletting that it so loves ? i had assumed that , since so many east european ecnomies are tied into west european ones , and share the downward demographic spiral -LRB- although not the upward muslim one -RRB- they would get dragged down part of the way too . a bit like britain . however , resourceful and skilled populations there may pull away once freed from the dead and patronising hand of euroleftism . which way do you think it will go ? yours , gavin
NEG simon you 'll be delighted to know that israel was attacked last week but i regret to inform you that no land was taken in retaliation . <a href=" "> 2054th kassam since disengagement strikes -LRB- israelnn.com -RRB- a `` kassam '' type rocket launched by terrorists from the northern gaza strip exploded wednesday evening without causing damage or casualties . the rocket apparently struck an unpopulated spot . according to idf 's oc southern command maj. gen. yoav galant , 2,053 kassams have hit israel since the disengagement .
NEG <a href=" "> a tragic accident happened at a russian nuclear-powered ice-breaker . very sad .
NEG america feels it is right to attack al quada and taliban positions . if in doing so there are innocent people killed -- so be it . on the other side al quada felt it had a reason for attacking america and the twin tower and if innocent people are killed so be it . so it goes around and around and around . and in the circle of mayhem and violence -- so many innocent people are killed . one is no better than the other -- and far as the innocent perishing . no one side can call the other bad / evil / vicious without labelling them self exactly the same . no one involved can call the other a ` terrorist with exposing themselves as a terrorist
POS `` churchill was half american '' . really ? which half was american ? his mother was an american but he was born in britain , thereby making him a british subject , a fact which should make you very proud .
NEU absolutely saibal . it takes years to build trust , but only an instant to demolish it .
NEU constantly . i have never claimed that i am anything but some guy posting on the internet . yes , on second thought , when you said `` please stop it '' , `` all this home-spun moralising is making me want to cry ! '' - i should have seen that as the friendly post it was . and i talked about the shallowness of making mass assumptions on a person based on either where they come from , or what t-shirt they are wearing . thats fine , if you see some guy wearing a t-shirt that says something you agree with and automatically feel you have `` more in common '' with them . that is great for you . i personally would talk to a person , get to know them and then decide if i have anything in common with them . the leader of their homeland or choice of t-shirt are not real pursuasive influences on me . so when you see a pimply faced kid wearing a `` i love vegetarians '' or a `` che guvera '' shirt on one side of the street , and a person wearing just a regular button down shirt , you automatically figure you have more in common with the kid ? okedoke .
NEU hmmm dangerous . that justifies someone trying to win them back .
POS usa and canada are very popular destinations for dutch emigrants . with a more sustainable population density , the attraction of the american continent is understandable .
NEU so , including switzerland , kurdistan , the turkish republic of northern cyprus , chechenya , nagorno karabakh , the kingdom of hay , scotland , euzkadi and the county of cockaigne ?
NEG well the real question is whether some are using the environment issue to deter the 3rd world countries to cathch up . if the west is really concerned about it , then everyone should share the responsibility on gdp per head terms . otherwise it 's going no where . how can you expect somebody living on & 163 ; 500 a year to cut down emission with you ? all that guy cares is how quickly he can make money to feed his family . when you sit comfortably in front of your & 163 ; 1000 pc in a & 163 ; 300,000 house distating what that poor chap should do to help you cut down pollution , what reaction would you expect from him ?
NEG a company called jd power ranks all us sold cars on reliability . it is a commercial venture , so i think links violate beeb rules . if you google , you will find plenty of data . toyhon have been at the top of jd power rankings for more than a decade . gm has moved into third over the past 5 years and is at a near dead heat or ahead in some categories . i personally have not owned a car in the five years since moving to new york , so i have zero personal stake in the debate . i did not mean to dismiss them . they sell well in the us . but their reliability records are poor . they largely sell on lower initial cost to people who think they otherwise have no choice . as i mention above in several spots , vw has done very poorly on jd power and other surveys . vw 's sales are down in the us as their cars are seen as an aspirational purchase and not a purchase of last choice . people who aspire to buy fashion cars may put up with some glitches , but there is a limit , as vw 's shrinking sales show .
NEU `` are other countries angry at the us for having to step in and control everything or are they more upset at their own countries ineptness towards wold affairs ? '' ah ! what a fine choice you offer . i have to follow my natural polling instinct and reply ` none of the above ' .
POS i do n't deny any of that - just helping you establish exactly the sort of leftie he was very anti communist -LRB- obviously -RRB- and anti stalinist . read the other article - it 's very good re why the left seem to be so anti-semetic etc. .
POS i 'm from lincolnshire , and we do n't think of it as `` surrounded on all sides by water '' or even `` surrounded on three sides by water and on the other side by scotland '' . to many in east anglia , lincolnshire , humberside and the east riding of yorkshire , the north sea is not so much a barrier as a road . it does n't so much divide us from the continent as it connects us to holland and denmark . -LRB- that 's probably why , for example , norwich airport has flights to amsterdam and copenhagen but not to london . it 's also why hull , the seventh largest city in england , is seen by many as a backwater . -RRB-
NEG in sultan , rather than indulge in other discussions , perhaps you would have the decency to provide the source about shatilla and sabra being a terrorist shoot out . or are you simply a zionist liar ?
NEG the big gamble for israel is in easing the blocade . if the islamic terrorist groups use this to restock their arsenals , then the conflict will kick off again in a few months but at a greater intensity .
NEG `` this is a world news message board , not a george orwell , or a woe is me , or the bbc are terrible lefties message board '' . as the bbc is a world wide news gathering organization , mm , would n't criticism directed their way be a part of world news ? the bbc does not restrict themselves to local politics only , though some believe that should be the case . and their news gathering idiosyncracies are gaining international recognition as well , if you ever were to read the wsj .
NEU are you jewish ?
NEG i have no time for your pedantic nonsense .
POS wow . smoker has nothing to say on this ?
NEG at miss world pageant . but wo n't her burka lessen her chances in the swimsuit competition ?
NEU indistinguishable from punjab . blimey , this is too easy . .
NEG once again you are twisting things . stay focused and on topic . > > he supported them before there was an israel < < the holocaust and jew terrorism saw to it that there was an israel , hence jewish colaboration with nazis . palestinians were being driven out of their homes in the 1930s . should i post a quote from ben gurion ? <blockquote class="quotefirst"> <blockquote> no he did n't . zionist education combined with talmud inspired lies . <blockquote> <div class="extraquotes"> am i to take it that you understand why the grand mufti went to the nazis for help in preventing his people from being driven from their homes ? somehow i doubt that . one rules for whitey and another for the rest .
POS john , that 's quite touching . i 'm glad to hear that you wo n't be making that mistake again ! yes , men are a mystery , too . how dull life would be if they were not .
NEG what 's all the fuss about ? israel has been launching its own military satellites for a few years now , several of which must be looking down on iran . as for it being targeted by russia , what 's new about that ? kgb troops were standing by to `` assist '' after sadat 's `` army '' had over-run israel in 1973 .
NEG `` if you do n't like jesus , go to hell . ''
POS if more women went around topless it would be a less opressed society and sex crimes will come down .
NEG no . if a bomber deliberately plants and detonates a bomb , and that bomb blows up civilians , the fault is that of the bomber . to blame the victims because they could have avoided it if they had happened to be somewhere else at the time is odious in the extreme .
NEG `` but george bush is the usa and that 's what you do n't get , no matter how many times it has to be explained to you '' ... do n't worry . we get it alright , every time we see an american missile or bomb blowing the head off a little child in rumsfeldt 's ` shock and awe ' , we do n't just think of gw cretin , we think of america .
POS if people are willing to pay then good on them . market forces , supply and demand and all that .
NEG muslim , arab , islamic `` extremist '' its all the same on this board is it not ? the bad guys ?
NEG 1500 copies ? surely your title should have been `` karl marx less unpopular '' . at that number , it could almost be accounted for by journalists getting copies to do their homework !
NEG both musso and hitler were christians . hitler told germmany he was doing god 's work . but seeing as you see things that way , how can you therefore claim that terrorism carrying out acts in the name of islam are true muslims ? you apply different rules in your reasoning and are never consistent .
NEG to antineocon - if anything is kept as secret as this one - secret f.o memo - then it means it is ` fishy ' and not to be taken as seriously .
NEG this looks like it may have been a revenge spree by the americans to avenge the death of a marine.if that is the case then the american soldiers did enjoy killing these women and children .
NEU / / their side of the story is poorer than the one i presented ; nonexistent wmds and a clear and present danger where there could n't possibly have been one . / / that 's your opinion and your entitled to it . however i will not take saddam 's side of the story at face value , he was not remotely trustworthy and in my opinion cooked up the whole story of kuwait stealing iraqi oil as a smokescreen to cover up the real reason for the invasion : he had bankrupted the iraqi economy and simply set out to plunder his wealthier neighbour , look at the widespread and systematic looting carried out by his forces in kuwait . / / i will condemn atrocities committed in kuwait that you 've made reference to but believe that iraq did and does have an historic claim on kuwait as iraqi territory . however , i concede that the un would have been a better arbiter in such a claim as opposed to the unilateral invasion that iraq undertook . / / i agree .
NEG `` to grant - / / which flag ? / / ... well according to that islamic leader , `` the black flag ... . '' it seems that whether it 's black , white , the skull and crossbones , or one with a crescent on it , it wo n't be the union jack for very long , jane . especially while so many europeans are accepting , if not actually embracing , radical islam and turning on their fellow democracies .
NEG al qaeda will not be making a base in iran - that 's ridiculous , as they hate the shia almost as much as they hate everyone else in the world .
NEU tiredandweary is n't true cornish virtually a language on its own ? j
NEG un peu -LRB- no t -RRB- ... as for the joke i would laugh if it were actually funny and in the case of france , original .
NEU very well . there 's no actual evidence of the kurds being gassed though , which was my point . just because churchill said some words about it , does n't mean it happened .
NEG i disagree , senator-dr . bill frist -LRB- doctors without boarders -RRB- is of the highest integrity and perhaps the most honest man in our government . hillary is up to her eye-balls in crooked dealings with lobbyists and mob connections . also , she is no bill clinton -LRB- not like-able -RRB- . people really despise her , she has approval ratings in the teens -LRB- less than half of bush 's lowest -RRB- .
NEG thank darwin for that . the number of rubbish office parties i 've been to where kevin from accounts decides he 's a lithe beach bum and can slide under the pole despite wearing a ridiculously uncomfortable suit and unsuitable shoes while having drunk a boat load of lager . and all in order to impress sharon from catering who really does n't fancy him plus she 's just been snogging phil from mis . grrr it makes me mad .
NEU capt 'n billy , was the desert song performed by mario lanza ? .
POS chavez is a good man . he is simply shutting down a station which is sympathetic to the usa , and we all know the usa want their hands on venezuelan oil . by shutting down this rogue tv station , he is acting in his nations security interests , which can only be a good thing . lets hope he allows al-jazeera to broadcast freely , as chavez is a friend of the muslim world . i have really grown to admire chavez in recent years . he is a very strong , compassionate , charismatic leader .
NEG red - quoting you < < i 'm sick of the brats banging on my door begging for sweets ... the little buggars should integrate better and stay at home if you ask me > > ... nobody is asking you ... but you need to know that ` trick n ' treat ' is in their country and it is their custom and no stranger is about to change it ... . .
NEG `` lord protector mcbean '' more analagous to charlesi i would have thought . particularly in respect of his constant financial demands of both parliament and his `` subjects '' . along with his scottishness too -LRB- it 's never a good idea giving a scot the unfettered reins of power for the whole of britain . it 's always been a disaster whenever it 's been tried before ! -RRB-
NEG the west sees musharraf as the lesser of two evils as if the extremists gain control in pakistan the brown smelly stuff will really hit the fan .
NEG lol . is that all you can come up with ?
NEU each to their own .
NEU on one of the things that you awakened in me , if the jewish lobby can get a memorial commemerating the holocaust lets hope the powers that be give the most courageous russian people who lost 20,000,000 souls
NEG iran does n't want `` peaceful '' energy it wants bombs . if iran or n korea just wanted energy then they would have taken the light-water reactor deals .
POS / / but israel has n't occupied lebanon since 2000 . / / israel still attacks hezbollah and detains its members so it 's a two-way street.the israelis have hundreds of prisoners hezbollah wants back.anyway the palestinian refugees in lebanon want their rightful homes and land back.they do have a just cause .
NEG message posted by colonelartist i am sure the americans soldiers who went wild and killed innocent people in jalabad didnt also mean to kill ... what is it that you people like to call it when the west doesnt mean to kill but still kills ? collateral damage or something . . ---------- can you for once post on the topic ? stop going off into left field .
NEU it is only an opinion sarah and it is not a criticism of americans . feel free to criticise the uk and the uk judicial system as you wish . i do n't take it personally .
NEG / / / several inventors , scientists , and engineers contributed to the development of radar . the use of radio waves to detect `` the presence of distant metallic objects via radio waves '' was first implemented in 1904 by christian hülsmeyer , -LSB- 2 -RSB- -LSB- 3 -RSB- who demonstrated the feasibility of detecting the presence of a ship in dense fog , but not its distance . he received a reichspatent patent nr . 165546 for his pre-radar device in april and on november 11 , 1904 the patent 169154 an amendment of his patent for ranging that is indirectly related to his device . he received a patent -LRB- gb13170 -RRB- in england for his telemobiloscope on september 22 1904 . -LSB- 2 -RSB- -LSB- 4 -RSB- prior to the second world war , developments by the americans -LRB- dr. robert m. page tested the first monopulse radar in 1934 -RRB- , -LSB- 5 -RSB- the germans , the french -LRB- french patent n ° 788795 in 1934 -RRB- , -LSB- 6 -RSB- and the british -LRB- british patent gb593017 by robert watson-watt in 1935 -RRB- , -LSB- 6 -RSB- -LSB- 7 -RSB- led to the first real radars . hungarian zoltán bay produced a working model by 1936 at the tungsram laboratory in the same vein / / / / ok , but it was a german who invented the concept , from which the americans came next , then the french , then germans again , then brits derived modern radar .
POS are you advocating that any minority be it large or small has the right to independence no matter were they live ?
NEG if you elect men of violence they do n't suddenly become respectable just because they start wearing a suit and tie . begin , peres , rabin and many more stopped being terrorists the momment they wore suits and were elected . ismail khan , general dostum stopped being terrorists when they shifted to suits , they are not being elected . so wearing a suit definatly makes one non-terrorist .
NEU gothicdoom - < < i see jack straw 's bigoted anti-muslim statement has been picked up by the big three ... . . > > and indeed it would because it is a frank acknowledgment of what lies behind the minds of many in our modern world of today , where there may be those who are understandably not too eager to speak their minds ... . but jack straw had the courage and did !
NEU it 's all made up and borrowed from earlier gods and religions . the christians even took 25th december as the birthday of jesus because it was the day mithras was born . still you ca n't stop people believing in myths and miracles and who would want to !
NEU exactly . we have enough of our own but that is n't a reason or excuse to import more . tougher border controls and deportation rules would have stopped or reduced the problem considerably .
NEG self-righteous drivel
NEG tony silver one day your a man of peace the next day your showing your true colours fact is you have shown many times that your an anti semite and a bigot . you spell jew or israel in anyway you like i dont really care it changes nothing about yout attitude .

'' i have no idea what the death toll is , and neither do you . <a href=" "> `` like i said - israel is the biggest dog in the me yard '' . and why is that , despite not having any natural resources . can you think of any reason for this apart from the education of its people their willingness to work hard ? `` so it does what it likes because international law , the authority of the un or any other measure of international governance does not apply to it '' . perhaps . would that be any different from the islamic terrorists who are attacking them ? i 'm of the fight fire with fire school so whining about only one side in a conflict matters little to me . either both sides follow the rules or the gloves come off . `` explain why israel has nuclear wepaons '' because they are a democracy governed by rational people . `` why it imprisoned vanunu for 20 yrs when he revealed this fact ? '' he broke the law . `` you liars say iran is an existential threat to israel '' - not just to israel . if i said it was just israel , and again you offer no quotes , then i was in error . these nut cases are a danger to everyone , though mostly to their own people . `` well the same can be said about the occupied welcome back and gaza '' . sure .
NEU although its a uk issue it has resonance across europe . as far as i know the uk is the only country that published sharia friendly finance law in its recent budget . it states : shariah finance 5.93 building on the success of the measures introduced in 2005 and arising out of ongoing consultation with industry , the government will introduce measures enabling shari’a compliant business finance by ensuring that : • wakala -LRB- agency -RRB- , diminishing musharaka -LRB- partnership finance -RRB- and ijara wa’iqtina -LRB- hire purchase -RRB- will be taxed similarly to their conventional equivalents ; and • the existing stamp duty land tax reliefs for alternative property finance products will be extended to all entities , including companies .

NEU i think not grant . many governments around the world are struggling to get big business to obey basic laws . in democracies governments that break the law are exposed and if the voters feel strongly enough they are punished at election time . business just plays one country off against another and threatens to move its head office to a different jurisdiction if someone demands it sticks to the rules . and we see from the sub-prime scandal that business does n't like sticking to the rules
NEU well lord seb , maybe i 'd argue with you if i wanted to praise castro to the rooftops , but since that was never my aim , i 'll let your assessment pass with a measure of agreement . as long as cuba , and castro 's regime , is seen in a proper context then i am satisfied .

NEG ruth , ok , what i 'm going to do this time is spell out my argument and supporting evidence as simply as i can . america invaded iraq to control its oil . you ask `` why do you think they want to control iraqi oil ? '' well , the answer is that oil is very useful to america . why is it very useful to america ? read this article : <a href=" "> in a previous post , you asked `` please explain when you think we 'll start balancing the scales against those billions already spent and the billions more to come . '' i pointed out that you were assuming i thought america would `` balance the scales '' at all . now you claim not to have made this assumption , but i 'm afraid you did . it 's there in black and white . how am i supposed to answer a question based on a false assumption ? i do n't know whether the american investment in iraq will bear dividends . i do n't think the americans do , either . `` if -LSB- the motive is -RSB- money ... at least explain why you think the us government would think it would be profitable . '' i 've had to cut out large chunks of your post to find this question , but i think it 's what you 're getting at . why did the us think it would be profitable ? well , in my opinion they had a much shorter war in mind . they wanted to fight a quick war with a small army , gain control of iraq , install military bases and a compliant `` puppet government , '' then leave . you 'll notice that i am not replying any more on the canada question . this is because i do n't think it merits any further response . if you really want me to write another post explaining in ever-increasing detail my reasons for believing that america will not invade canada , i 'll be happy to do so . but i 'm hoping against hope that you 'll just let it drop .

NEG english please . there is no such thing as the `` british '' judicial system .
NEG the article points out - `` while the president 's sentiments about invading iraq were known at the time ... '' so there is nothing new in this . the article is talking about a second un resolution and it is well known that the us were not in favour of one , believing that the existing un resolutions were sufficient . it was blair -LRB- the usual incompetent blair0 who wanted a second resolution - to appease his opwn party , and bush agreed to help him -RRB- . in a joint press conference before the wart bush clearly pointed out the purpose was ` regime change ' - this is always been clear and not covered up by the us . the french were busy making money out of saddam and we now know all about the illegal oil for fraud scam .

NEG marley : it is hyphenated because some people prefer to be hyphenated ... if you are black in the us , you can decide to be an american who is black , or you can choose to be a black-american ... if you are black in the us , you can decide to be an attorney who is black , or you can decide to be a black attorney ... this attitude contributes to some blacks separating themselves from being just people who happen to be black ...
NEU there can be a positive correlation , without a one-to-one correspondence . probably because their neo-conness gives them delusions of being able to get away with it . who knows , they may be right .
NEG ah blue sea , nice to see the postings divorced from their context . no doubt you think you are very clever , but actually its a bit of a cheat . however , this reminded me of something : `` the jews have been a corpus separatum for more than three thousand years and counting . '' how might that be ? jews are not the only group of people who have lived apart from their neighbours , or who have been driven from their original lands . you have the example of the chinese communities dotted around southern asia , you have the roma . historically you have the huguenots , the cathars , the alans , the sassanid . and additionally you have the expat communities of bankers and traders , lombards , venetians , netherlanders , even scots . they 've left their traces in family names in odd places , street names , churches and houses . historically all have been shunned and persecuted from time to time . historically too all have eventually assimilated into their host community through inter-marriage and such . except the roma , whose wandering life style rather precludes assimilation . jews assimilate too , but there must be some special reason for the supposed 3000 year `` corpus separatum '' .
NEU no point in having a new toy if you ca n't play with it , right ? as to `` illegal war '' : i did n't follow the machinations of the build up to the iraq invasion too closely , but if you have a quick google , you 'll probably find that there was some argument over the need for a -LSB- 2nd -RSB- un resolution , which was sought , but not secured , prior to invasion , as i recall . best regards rad

NEG it has been finished for ages.they are just waiting for the radioactive goodies arriving from russia to get it on line .
NEU double lol !!! the idea that israeli press is not free was reported by - the israeli press . you are right its sour grapes because journalists were n't allowed to enter a war zone at risk to themselves and the troops if they reported operational details . not suprising when you remember bowen 's and guerin 's performance in the lebanon as hezbollah stooges . bowen was recently criticised for not showing due impartiality or being accurate in his reporting of the israel/palestinian conflict .
NEG of course the men are out fighting , as are many of the israeli men . or are there me not allowed to fight like yours ? every isareli bomb shelter i have seen is mostly women and children and elderly , are they human shields ?

NEG of course we condemn muslim terrorists . i have never for one second agreed with anything they have done . but did america have to become christian terrorists in their since 9/11 actions ? america in not banning the use of cluster bombs which kill so many innocent people - are in my mind in the same category as the muslim suicide bomber .
NEU the un peacekeeping force is in effect a police force , it is not meant to do anything ` militarily effective ' , its primary role is as observers and will only be called into action to protect human life . i dont know where you get your facts about the un peacekeepers raping people , perhaps you have been reading too many tom clancey novels ?

NEG i think that ms. royal 's sudden rise in popularity can be seen , from a european perspective , as a conveniant counter-balance to the new german chancellor . who will inevitably fall at the final fence in respect of a transatlantic tariff removal . neither the u.s. or the french will agree to an end to subsidies to farmers , which would be prerequisite for any such removal of tariffs . funny how the `` leader of the free world '' manages its own economy along the same lines as the `` cheese-eating surrender monkeys '' !

NEG \ \ i 'm really very impressed with the effort you went to in gathering those quotes , captainlogic , and i recall most of them myself . \ \ grant , i can assure you that the effort was minimal . one minute of searching produces scores of such comments -LRB- and worse -RRB- from the us right wing , ironically the people you seem to identify with most closely . and those quotes are recent -LRB- from the last 1 to 3 years -RRB- , so your claim that things have changed does n't ring true . \ \ we are very close , and canada could n't want for better neighbours . \ \ thats not how it appears , at least for some . another quote i saw was that `` canada needs the us , but the us does not need canada '' and please do n't try to speak for europeans in their entirety . if course there are differences between eu member states , but for the most part we get along just fine . you should stop gleaning your world view from rabid right wing media and actually come and visit us over here some time .

NEG how nieve that people here think that handing over the soldier will mean an end to the problem ? israel has been holding gaza and the west bank hostage for 66 years ! will handing over the soldier mean that israel will withdraw to the pre-67 border ? will it mean the right of return for the palestinian refugees ? will it mean the release of the palestinian kids and women from israeli prisions ? will it mean that israel will stop the incessant shelling on the occupied territories and stops arrresting palestinian freely ? i think not ! israel must stop its arrogant wrong policy and seek for peace through diplomacy and not bullets , if it wants to live in peace among its arab neighbours ! say to israel , enough of bloodshed and be civilized ! .

NEG possibly so , but it still represents only the wsj and not `` america '' oh dear . trying to yoke together the idea that anti-business is the same as unreliable ... . . anyway i 'm not trying to argue that the wsj is a shabby rag , i quite agree that it has a solid professional reputation . i 'm merely pointing out that it represents only one strand of opinion . actually yes , or at least it was heading that way . europe was in the process of recovering from ww2 and withdrawing from its various empires . europe 's r & d was falling behind the soviets , never mind the americans and europe 's economies were stagnant . back in the 1950 's the deutschmark was mickey mouse money and the french franc traded at 1000 's to the dollar . and the british pound was part way through a long decline . no , but a europe of mutually suspicious nations that can be played off against each other might suit . not so suspicious that another war was a possibility but certainly the wsj would approve of a europe where the various nations competed in lowering taxes and regulations on business . business always likes governments to engage in a race to the bottom on workers rights , environmental protection and corporate taxation . -LRB- if you think states should race to the bottom like that then maybe you should do the decent thing and tell us why you think workers should have little or no job security , why polluters should get away scot free and why the burden of taxation should fall disproportionately on the middle incomes and lower -RRB-

NEG insultan the new palestian pm could shoot another arab in the head and huindreds of pals could be eyewitnesses and watch it happen and it could be on live tv . if they were later told by the pm that the man with a bullet in his head was killed by an israeli <a target="_top" href="/dna/mbfivelive/f16"> f16 </a> most of them would buy it .
NEG pillock . what is the `` intrinsic relative value '' of anything ? that 's just gibberish . p.s. why do n't you get `` eu mutuals '' to organise the bartering . p.p.s. do n't bother whining to the mods , they 've already ruled that `` pillock '' is acceptable .
NEG `` so its ok to post anti-muslim posts ? '' no . anti-islam posts . it is important to understand the difference between opposing an illiberal ideology , such as islam , and being racist .
NEG tell me ms.mcneil what is you prefered news source ? your leading questions are making a lot of assumptions that give readers rather more of an accurate insight into your particular view points than mine ! you 'll have to get down off your high horse and take a deep breath before i can have a rational debate with you ms.mcneil .
POS they could be someone like george galloway . -LRB- anyone seen his beard recently ? funny is n't it ? -RRB-
POS no i dont need to educate the people who are already highly edcuated .
NEG i did , and i stand by my remarks . your ` above ' post adds even more substance to the belief that you have no understanding of the separation of powers .
POS you posted it you great numpty.i have explained to you that i am on your side.i just think you could do a lot better.there was a tremendous opportunity to achieve positive things after 9/11 . the world was with you.instead bush completely squandered all the goodwill .
NEG no its only the israelians who can sue .
NEG <blockquote class="quotefirst"> <blockquote> <blockquote> <div class="extraquotes2"> which race are ` muzlins ' , solomoron ?
NEU the president of nigeria has assembled a team of economic advisors to work towards a sollution for nigeria 's slumping economy . nigeria obtains approximately 95 % of its overall revenue from the sale of oil . with the slump in oil prices nigerians have seen a 20 % decrease in the value of their currency . its always good to see a leader/government be reactive to economic crisis -LRB- its even better when they are proactive in avoiding crisis -RRB- . however , financial experts suggest there may be little nigeria can do as long as the nigerian economy is so heavily dependent on the sale of oil . nigeria is not known as a tourist destination so a campaign to draw tourists seems unlikely , anyone have any thoughts on new directions , revenue options nigeria might consider ? <a href=" "> news.bbc.co.uk / 2/hi / ... </a>
NEG one only has to look at amnesty international 's 1977 nobel peace prize work to see just what an intolerant regime malaysia has . all , of course , a consequence of post-ww2 attempts to limit chinese expansion by the british !
NEG in a pig 's valise you have !!
NEG if that is the case , then `` militant '' would be an acceptable term for islamist terrorists , rather than `` terrorist '' . there are islamic groups whose objections stop at demonstrations and words , they would consider themselves militant but not violent . it is not required for militants to be violent . hmm , which word , phrase or website is forbidden i wonder ?
NEU i think thats where the thermite theory comes in .
NEG m2l2j3 `` it never fails to amaze me how you and the rest of your ilk try to rewrite history . '' yo dude ... the only ones trying to rewrite history are the likes of you . put the following in your cafe latte and choke it down : arms sales to iraq under saddam :1973 -1990 russia : 57 % france : 13 % china 12 % czech : 7 % poland : 4 % brazil : 2 % egypt , romania , denmark , lbyia , and us : 1 % each your words are haunting you : `` nice try , but as you know , the whole world knows the truth ''
NEU why does it need anyone to check them ? i am sure they are all healthy and in good condition . when france , pakistan , india , uk and usa let al baradei check their nuclear weapons i 'm sure israel will feel a lot easier about it . as a purely defensive measure there is no point in checking them .
NEG salome samadashvili , georgia 's envoy to the eu , has appealed to the eu to take a stance against the russian invasion . `` she expressed disappointment the eu has not reacted more forcefully to the crisis in her country . `` so far there has not been even a properly worded official statement that would tell them -LRB- the russian -RRB- clearly that they have to stop and that they risk their future relationship with the european union if they do n't , '' she added . '' <a href=" "> i feel sorry for this envoy , she 's about to get a fundamental lesson in euro politics that was harshly learned by the jews 70 years ago ...
NEG never been there . > > swimming pools in the bankstown area are closed for certain times of the day so that muslim girls can swim < < how terrible . in the uk we have women only swimming sessions . is n't that the same ? > > driving licenses can have muslim woman covering there face as a picture -LRB- begs the question what 's the point then ? -RRB- < < that is ridiculous . perhaps oz is to blame for that and not the muslim women . > > the mufti of australia demanding that the labor party -LRB- state government of nsw -RRB- have a muslim in parliment < < how does that change the culture of oz . he wants a muslim to work in an oz system . hardly changing the culture . we had the black section of the labour party here demanding an all black shortlist for potemtial candidates . did settlers assimilate into aborogine culture or did they demand the aboroginals assimilate into their culture ? that is after they nearly wiped out all of them .
NEG with all her millions she could move to a nice place with great weather where the paparazzi would no longer be an issue . apparently its just the opposite tho , she or one of her people calls the paparazzi ahead of time to give them a heads up about her plans for the day . if her mental state is so fragile already , just imagine what she will be like when the press no longer cares .
NEU oh blimey . it was just a piece of innocent good old english black humour . we brits are famous for it . anyone who ca n't take what is a bit of obvious ` jest ' is not human . moderators included .
NEG looks like the civilian engineers were engaged in well-digging and reservoir engineering . trying to bring fresh water and sanitation to the iraqi population merits a death sentence in azania 's book .
NEG straw man argument . you are defining insurgent attacks as either terror attacks or attacks on us soldiers . then you are saying that since more civilians are dying than us soldiers , the insurgents are killing more civilians than soldiers .
NEG < < lol ! it took me about 25 seconds to rubbish his argument ... > > lol ! what you mean is , it took you about 25 secs to delude yourself into thinking you have a counter-argument when all you proposed was tautological nonsense ! what came first , the pro-israel policy of the us govt. , or the first gulf war , hmmmm ? < < ... people like chomsky are not only not prominent jews ... but ... . . you hate israel simply because you hate the us and the west ... etc > > get real ! if i hated america and the west i would n't have cheered at the recent elections in the usa and i would n't bother to wish tb , the little chore-boy belonging to gwb , out of office in my homeland of the uk ... furthermore , if you do n't think chomsky is famous both as a jew and as a linguist with outspoken and well-known political views against the us/israel alliance , then where have you been all these years , besides studying hard at your zionist propaganda 101 course ... ??
NEU well , no . but then the q ` ran does n't refer to recipes for apple crumble , motor cycle mechanics or music hall . so - what ?
NEG message posted by bordeaux57 `` nothing in my post disputed the inclusivity of hmd -LRB- other than the armenian genocide -RRB- . i pointed out that though the armenian church disputes hmd they do not boycott . i also stated that i felt that the view of politicos handwringing for a few moments doesnt fit well with the dignity of the memory . so what point have i missed in that re rwanda ? '' i was making the point about hmd being inclusive - one of ghe reasons often cited for the day being unjustified is that it is n't . i have only accused the mcb of boycotting hmd because they refuse to accept the invitation . -LRB- for those who refuse to accept the part played by the holocaust in the creation of israel , please make a note -RRB- . so i guess it was this that made me think you were emphasising a lack of inclusivity ... i may have misinterpreted that . `` both genocides along with other massacres should be studied and quitely commemorated with permanent memorials . hmd somehow demeans the whole '' however , i do not share your opinion of hmd being in any way demeaning . the service is quiet and dignified and it is quite correct that `` politicos '' are reminded of what the consequences of their actions are . referring to such commemorations as `` handwringing '' does rather suggest to me that it is those who do not like such days who have less respect for some tragedies than others .
POS well put jasb !
NEG nothing is stoping the rest of the world , no one cares . bolton and his government pick and choose when to ` liberate ' countries when its in their interests .
NEU grant , why do you and jj insist on using personal attacks when some one disagrees or just refuses to argue with you ? i have no intentions of continuing this argument because i am never going to change your mind , nor do i wish to . it is just not worth my time or energy , as i am sure it is not worth your time or energy . you must have better things to do with your time than try to argue a point with some one who does not share your point of view or your convictions or beliefs or anything really , other than the love of travel . if you were a dear friend , then it would be worth my while as your friendship would mean a great deal to me , however , you are a stranger , nothing more . i do not take anything anyone says on these boards seriously , it 's strictly to pass the time for me as i sit through conference calls , nothing more . as it should be for you , strictly to pass the time . so , live long and prosper , rita .
NEG someone tell him bush and blair will be leaving office in the near future before he starts to raise an army .
NEG grant , although religion does play a part in the recrutment of terrorists , the primary reason for terrorist attacks is a response to the occupation of foreign lands by western governments . you leave them alone , the attacks stop has history not shown us this ?
NEG sorry , that was for tonker -LRB- little wiener , as i know him -RRB-
NEG i said bush lied about the whole wmd thing . you are trying to use the supposed humanitarian angle -LRB- which in fact iraq is now far worse and should have some humanitarian intervention as those in charge are clueless and useless -RRB- .
NEG and you post the words that suit your agenda and critise the other words in koran ? well , either you believe in everything which it says , or nothing . selectiveness in g-d 's words is not allowed , but again you are not muslim , so you would do exactly what you are doing .
NEU `` what alternative do you suggest instead of soup kitchens ? '' ... ... ... ... ... a society which provides a decent ` social service ' to all which provides a ` safety net ' for the poorest and homeless . they get money and housing etc. free . not something that the boneheads could imagine . no soup kitchens here old chap . it 's called civilisation .
POS have you ever considered being a professional satirist albert ? you 're absolutely brilliant , all this cretin stuff really cracks me up . its right on the button - genius at work .
POS hi ozy , it is quite interesting to hear you say this because one of the ongoing debates on this board is the re-electing of bush vs. the re-electing of blair . uk posters often say that they find it incomprehendible that americans re-elected bush . when us posters in-turn ask uk why blair was re-elected , we are often told it was because of domestic issues and that voters felt blair was very strong on internal british interests . and here you are suggesting that mr. blair did not take british interests seriously . of course there is always going to be differing opinion . but from what we have generally heard on these boards , the one positive attribute that most uk posters have praised mr. blair on was a strong policy of british interest .
NEG ruth , my e-mail message simply says ` it 's against house rules and that some posters may be offended ' . this does n't help as it can refer to many posts and it does n't clarify areas of inconsistency . ps . i 'm quite over extended myself in replying to posts and they all seem to be middle east related . i suppose i 'm to blame for joining the threads .
NEG eh ? that depends on your definition of natural . it is natural for homosexuals to be homosexuals . where have i said otherwise ? is this another talmud inspired lie ? after all , jews are permitted to lie to gentiles to make their point -LRB- talmud again -RRB- .
NEG ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ would n't like someone to come and claim even my coal cellar as his own , would you ? ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ well teresa an ethnic roman of one 's aquaintance -LRB- descended he claims from claudius -RRB- has this idea that there an imperial right for all romans to re-settle londonium at any time . one understands that his elephants are already massing on the docks at calais awaiting suitable cross channel transport . have suggested that he fits them with water wings and teaches them to swim !
NEG here is your independence day , so read it and weep : <a href=" "> we evil white brits are damned if we do , and damned if we do n't . your lot though , you do n't even aspire to the damned . you just hold your head up high while beating the poor , the sick and the elderly . you 're ruled by a class of people unto themeselves , those who by their very actions gave colonalism a good name a looooong time ago . congrats .
NEG wake up ... stop kidding yourself ... noone just invade a country , especially blessed with the resources on which the west exist-oil , to just leave it ... do you recall one important thing that went missing in all the planning prepartions ? the future plan for iraq ... too bad your journalists who flocked bagdad like vultures were cowards who didnt even have the nerve or maybe they didnt want to do , ask any of your lying evil leader about the future plan of iraq ...
NEG if those muslim terrorists scum didnt do 9/11 , no one will ever bother about iraq / afghanistan ; imho no one should ever bother about islamic countries ; if any one do attacks like 9/11 , they should be dealt harshly so that no islamic terrorist will ever dream of doing terrorist attacks ------------------------------------------------- and if america had withdrawned its forces from saudi arabia after liberating kuwait , ben laden and other non saudi , saudi arabians wouldnt have to start opposition campagain against the king , and , and if the americans had withdrawn the troops from saudi arabia , they wouldnt have to tell the king to kick ben laden out of country and go to somalia , and if americans hadnt destroyed his asprin factory in somalia and forced somalia to kick ben laden he would not have come to afghanistan ...
NEG the breach of the british-polish-french agreement was the single greatest treachery in modern times . but i digress ... iirc uk history channel ran a program based on the newly released telegrams between roosvelt and churchill ... was very telling ... de gaul was very seriously in danger of being shot ...
POS i_pardon_u re your last sentence : this entire thread has so far been restricted to ` western ' art and although mistress raised social/cultural influences these were not explored beyond western ` limitations ' and indeed all the references to ` great ' art i the thread have been ` western ' , ie perhaps 20 % or less of the world . and yet in this so called era of ` globalisation ' surely communication via art should be simpler/more natural and provide greater ` meeting of minds ' than the communication of politics . you must be right about the arbitray selection of scales , be they 8 tone or 12 tone but i have no knowledge of wider global music - beyond indian music which was intially brought to me via the affinity between yehudi menhuin and ravi shankar , -LRB- apologies for any spelling errors -RRB- . your point about the ` social aspect ' of music is clear , and demonstrated in so many ways from being part of moods for celebrations or sad occasions etc but in these cases it is incidental to , even though in sympathy with , the main social event . so i continue to submit that music - and other art forms , are personal at a ` higher level ' - in terms of both the motivation of the originator and the ` meaning ' to the recipient . j
NEG the cia has so far refused to hand over control of iraq 's intelligence service to the newly elected iraqi government in a turf war that exposes serious doubts the bush administration has over the ability of iraqi leaders to fight the insurgency and worries about the new government 's close ties to iran . the director of iraq 's secret police , a general who took part in a failed coup attempt against saddam hussein , was handpicked and funded by the u.s. government , and he still reports directly to the cia , iraqi politicians and intelligence officials in baghdad said last week . immediately after the elections in january , several iraqi officials said , u.s. forces stashed the sensitive national intelligence archives of the past year inside american headquarters in baghdad in order to keep them off-limits to the new government .
NEG ????? where did you learn 2 % * 10 % = 20 % ??? it is 0.2 % or 20 basis points silly !
NEU ... i know ; i wish they would ! the media needs a good clearout of rot and pap . p.s. both your constitution threads were just closed on the uk board .
NEG maybe you should tell that to them . they believe they have some form of ` mandate ' from the people . it wo n't be long before they screw-up , and americans go off electing jorge bush iii . yes , the fulfilling politics of vindictiveness !
NEU an act of settlement made a lot of jacobites overnight .
NEG quote > that day cant come soon enough . let the jews come back to their rightful homeland if they want to -LRB- europe or us -RRB- . if they dont them let them remain as citizens of a free and secular palestinian state . what makes you say that the jews rightful homeland is the us or europe as opposed to israel ? are you not aware of history ?! as for a secular palestinian state - very unlikely - given the popularity of radical islamic groups it is very unlikely it will be a secular state .
NEU pps , found no evidence of ` deliberate distortion or culpable negligence ' in the treatment of pre-war intelligence . -LRB- butler report -RRB- .
POS that is a pretty bold statement , but i do give you kudos for at least having the strength of conviction to put an actual date stamp on your prediction . 20 days left for your prediction to come true .
NEU attempts to reduce this will fail unless more is done . so says a recent report at <a href=" "> news.bbc.co.uk / 1/hi / ... </a> . we 've had had a go at schools , parents and government awareness campaigns but is it time for some sensible legislation , eg to reduce sweetie advertising , -LRB- as eg cigarettes -RRB- , to stop supermarkets stacking sweets by the check out and so on . the fact is that sweets/chocs etc are such huge business that ` voluntary measures ' by manufactures and retailers are unlikely to work . another freedom vs nanny state dilemma or common sense ? what is the relevant legislation in your country , if any ? j
NEU i enjoyed haifa during my short time at that port.can ' t remember which ship i was on as i was very , very drunk at the time .
NEG you say bush will spend # 6.5 bn . on the disater . in fact he will not spend a single penny . the belief that he will is a common misconception . there is many a slip between money allocated and cash recieved . poverty and need does not mean a deficiency in accommodation , food , water , transport or security . it means a financial deficit in cash . 10,000 people died in the hurricane . all of them were poor . no social worker died in the hurricane . it will cost # 7bn . to process the corpses and all that cash will go to the wealthy . # 1000 cash would have saved all their lives but none all of it would have gone to the poor . people are either concerned about poverty or gannets . nobody can be concerned about poverty and gannets . whatever food goes to a gannet does not get to the poor . nobody can have their cake and eat it . either the poor can be fed or the gannets who hang around them distributing `` services '' . all governments should produce properly audited accounts detailing the disparity between cash designated and cash recieved . poverty relief , broadly concieved , is grand larceny on a massive scale sustaining a flock of gannets half the size of the whole population and guess what ? they all happen to work in the public sector , the same sector which recieves the taxation distributed .
NEG grant , ne'er count on the yanks .
NEG pax , i 'm denying those noble treaties , however we are talking about some unclear definitions here under specific circumstance that collide with us rights and law . the most vexing is applying a definition and rules , in this case ' of whether or not the techniques used do or do not constitute torture and do conflict with the right to self defense from an imminent attack by terrorists .
NEG / / but brandon/parker was inferring that there was some sort of sinister jewish cabal -LRB- presumably including me -RRB- on this very message board / / it was reported that there are jewish cybersoldiers at work on the forums and naz 's post soon found its way up to one of the top jews -LRB- melanie phillips -RRB- who used her job to pressurise the bbc into removing it although they did not consider it to have broken any rules.it is sinister to subvert normal discussion on all the message boards and forums .
POS for making america so rich and powerful . thanks all ' you are the best and certainly know how to reward your favourite sons and daughters .
NEU heres one example that i expect is typical . i suppose it comes down to simple business logic . `` rural bank for micro-finance thp-malawi continues to disburse credit , especially through the existing revolving loan fund of awffi . the repayment rate of loans has improved tremendously . while men are trailing with a payback rate of 70 % , women , who receive most of the loans , have a payback rate of close to 95 % . we expect that by next year one or two of our rural banks qualify for government accreditation to operate as official financial institutions in malawi . '' <a href=" ">
NEG no , she 's not . can we get a real muslim please ?!
NEG yes , lots of countries would not like to see iran get the bomb . not that that makes a scrap of difference to the question i asked you . the us is doing the sabre rattling and did issue a direct threat in the past . please have another go at answering the question .
NEU i suppose we could all try the orthodox jewish way , through an hole in the sheet .
NEG some of its members were donald rumsfeld , dick cheney , james woolsey , paul wolfowitz , richard perle , bill kristol , james bolton , zalmay m. khalilzad , william bennett , dan quayle , jeb bush . all very minor figures pete ?
NEG bleeding national pride . for india , ceding kashmir could lead to the break up of the country . other provinces , in particular the sikhs , will demand their independance also .
NEG `` maybe you can account for the brits emigrating ... could it be the weather ? the rising crime ? the high taxes ? the muslim / african / eastern european immigration stresses ? '' no j.j. whenever i 've asked , the reply has always been along the lines of : `` i 'm not living here any longer because our government has embroiled us in an ridiculously expensive illegal war , against the wishes of the majority of the electorate , started by that muppet in the white house ! ''
NEG how odd that upyerpipe 's original post is now currently being hidden . yet , considering that upyerpipe is in pre-mod , his original post would have been read , reviewed and approved for posting by a moderator . perhaps moderator vs. moderator disagreement ?
NEG `` placing a bet , colonel ? next thing you 'll be telling us you 've got an investment account with the woolwich and you finish your day with a hot toddy spiked with malt whisky '' . are muslims not allowed to place a bet , teresa meyer ? and yet the colonel did it anyway ? how about that colonel ? is it true ? how will you be punished ?
NEG `` what 's the point if everyone who points this out is dismissed as a ` whinger ' ? '' grant , you wo n't be dismissed as a whinger if you can provide substantive evidence of this alleged ` serious downhill slide'in us/uk relationships . but you have n't . your opinion piece specifically excludes britain from it 's main claims . `` do you really believe that relations have improved since that article was written five years ago ? '' no grant , in respect of us/uk relations i doubt that much has changed significantly in that time but since the article indicates good us/uk relations -LRB- that 's the british leader depicted alongside the us president -RRB- no change does n't amount to the ` serious downhill slide ' you have claimed . as is typical of you grant you have linked to an article without reading and understanding it . it uses unnamed sources which you grant have said should always be condemned . do you condemn their use in this article grant , yes or no ? it acuses american of ` impressive ignorance ' . do you agree with it grant , yes or no ? most significantly grant you yourself have declared this article out of date . in a previous feeble attempt to show a ` serious downhill slide ' in us/uk relations -LRB- another occasion when you failed to read and understand the article you linked to -RRB- you claimed french and german relations with the us were very good . now grant , do you think things have improved for relations between the us and france and germany since the article , yes or no ? `` prove it ! '' i do n't need to i 'm not the one claiming any great change , you are . now can you prove it ? `` it 's difficult to believe how very stupid you brits have become over the past couple of generations ! '' ha , ha , ha ! poor grant , has got his knickers in a twist .
NEG <a href=" "> news.bbc.co.uk / 1/hi / ... </a> computer chipmaker intel has been fined a record 1.06 bn euros -LRB- $ 1.45 bn ; # 948m -RRB- by the european commission for anti-competitive practices . it dwarfs the 497m euro fine levied on microsoft in 2004 for abusing its dominant market position . the commission found that between 2002 and 2007 , intel had paid manufacturers and a retailer to favour its products . the investigation followed a complaint by the world 's second-biggest chipmaker advanced micro devices -LRB- amd -RRB- . the commission said that acer , dell , hp , lenovo and nec had been given hidden rebates if they only used intel chips . ouch .
NEU that is n't the point . the point is that they publicly rent the site out but are explicitly limiting that to specific groups . if another camp site refused to rent their site to any christians , i 'm sure this group would be among the first to complain . the root question is whether we want to kind of stratified society where each subgroup lives and works in their own little world . how could they ? there are homosexuals and christians throughout society - it would be impossible for them to avoid each other . most christians -LRB- and most homosexuals -RRB- have come to accept that and a fair few people are both .
NEG yawn always the same anti-american drivel from the usual suspect btw , how is your buddy bin laden ? still alive ?
NEG you obvioulsy have no idea what george bush is like . just your media induced paranoia .
NEG is this thread still wheezing on ? i thought i 'd killed it on message 2 !!
NEU what do you think of the guardian btw ?
NEG perhaps isr , it would help if you stopped infantilising the afghans .
NEG `` everywhere but quebec , dear '' . darn ! i 'm going to miss her .
NEG ad hom cop out . if you think you 're too clever for this board , then join one on mensa 's website . i second the request : please explain that comment .
NEG there is no relation . everyone except for those who willingly chose not to know , knew what will happen in iraq under occupation .
NEG i 'm not sure you and the others understand . the grand mufti angle , -LRB- and all your other propaganda angles -RRB- has no impact on anyone . my enemys enemy is my friend ? look at who britain have teamed up with in the past , and the damage we have caused . including palestine . palestine was wiped off the map . what year did the mufti meet hitler ? the holocaust wasnt suggested until about december 1941 , according to jewish holocaust experts . like i say though , this along with most of the other hate propaganda has no impact . probably makes western subliminally pro-israeli neutral gentiles more sympathetic to pals .
NEU royal and zax : palin is not a religious nutcase . you are resorting to name-calling with absolutely no evidence . palin is constantly being misrepresented by the media and the left . rather than just repeating what you you 've been told by the god 's of media , please explain how you believe she is a `` religious nutcase . ''
NEG it has now come out , on newnight last night , that britain supplied israel with ` heavy water ' to help them build nuclear weapons . infact , britain sold it for vast amounts of money . apparently the usa knew nothing of this . it is now believed , according to the same program , that terrorists are soon to be in possession of nuclear weapons . vanunu was right when he said the world should be freed from these wmd . i fear it is too late now .
NEG as from today , angela merkel takes over her role as chancellor of germany . she is going to have a difficult time . already knicknamed the iron-lady , merkel has announced cuts in pensions for civil-servants and the highest increase in vat in germanys history . the heads the grand coalition and is disliked by many .
NEG message posted by zebras viewpoint the pope sees his flock slipping away - and his outbursts will only see more of his flock exiting the vatican pastures ------- maybe you should ban religion ? que f1 .
NEG and what ` irrational domestic agenda ' was that ? the one which led to the sustained economic boom we see there today ? can you prehaps compare the us with the more ` rational ' european agendas and demonstrate where you 're better off ? i 'm really keen to hear your explanation for the ` root causes ' of international terrorism . there has n't been enough of these poorly thought out cliches coming from that area of the world for the last day or so .
NEG it was pointed out on an american tv network , that when this and chavez spoke in the un , many of the seats were empty . in some cases only the lowest member of each delegation was present to hear what either men had to say . mind you those who did say applauded cahvez as he finished , but that was propably like listening to an alan bennnett monologue .
NEG that `` choice '' is technically known as `` sedition '' and people are executed for it . if the uk cares so much , then why do n't they just go back and re-draw those borders again like they did 100 years ago -LRB- when they had a real military force -RRB- .
NEG let me get this right , israel buys weapons from the u.s. with the american money given to them as aid , israel then turns around and sells her own built weapons to china and in the past south africa . do i read you correctly ? if so macbeth 's `` o , what a web we weave when try to deceive '' comes to mind .
NEU the above writing of colonel confirms my point , that socialism and islam are so similar . non-believers `` will be delt with '' ------------------------------------------------- was it stalin or lenin or karl marx who went up all the way to dagistan in the early yrs of the socialist movment and seeked helped from the muslims ???? every system or belief and their followers will always come to muslims ... . you know why ? because islam is the only religon that does not tolarate oppression and cherish freedom ... do you know why ? because our g-d detest people who oppress ... its unacceptable to him ...
NEG by the way news just in that rita has now become a category 4 hurricane .
NEU said one of the forum 's four horsemen of the apocalypse ...
NEG rather numbing watching this unfold on tv all over again . it looked like absolute chaos watching 10,000 dawson students fleeing that campus then wondering panicked around the city trying to find their friends . lets hope those kids on life support will pull through .
NEU good point . based on the posts under the carl-jones and john-salisbury names , we can leave the three ks to united kkkingdom and denmarkkk . enjoy .
NEG missippi so tonys proposal of encouraging posative discrimination against jews because they control the world economy is no longer enough now murder is the only solution its just a shame that we are in the 21 century and we still have people who think this way
NEG and the same ismail khan the war criminal who looted the un truck conveys ... that is the guy you are willing to trust ??? he is nothing but a liar , a criminal and murderer ... just like his counter parts in usa and uk ...
NEG it 's amazing . 100 + people dead - of all nationalities - and all handyman can do is provoke an argument about israel .
NEU i hope they outsource the war with iran to israel . we 'll be coughing up the tax funds for the irac one for years to come .
NEG cost me ten quid to call us embassy to complain my check was late !
NEG ally !!! how could you insinuate such a think about madonna ? . she would never ever do anything just for the publicity . ever . a lady with such a heart ? . never ! . not a multi-millionairesse whose backing guitarist of 28 years died of poverty and neglect in a public hospital .
NEG / / / / / yes but why do you support israel ? are you attracted to people who hi-jacked someone else 's country ? / / / / / / lol !!! that is very funny ! why do people support palestinians ? do they support terrorism and groups with charters to ethnically cleanse jews from israel ?
POS quite right green day .
NEG a country which forced the inhabitants to leave it by hook or by crook should be banned from taking any refugees.whats more sudan should keep any eye on israel or else it will steal sudaneese citizens just to fill its own diffuse and ever changing borders .
NEG iraq was not a threat to the usa you are wrong right there , so no need to go further .
NEG you begger belief mcneil . just sneer down that nose of yours , but ohj if it were a jew suffering , now that would be differant
NEU tony , islam will not win peace through rockets or suicide bombs . the dust will settle from all this a week after it is over and israel will be the darling of the west again as soon as the next suicide bomb goes off in our countries . you know this to be true . you wo n't admit it because you are deluding yourself into thinking any of this makes the blindest bit of difference . nobody really hates israel in the west . as soon as the drama is over , back to normal . everyone still hates islamic terror . they always will . you can not win . you can only win through diplomacy as the west will never give in to terror
NEG piltdown ` the us signed a convention outlawing all chemical weapons in 1972 . ' yes but this is another of those moot points , like napalm and white phophorous etc , ie the use of the chemical is not specifically aimed at people , eg the dioxin example was to clear forestation . people become ` collateral damage ' or ` should not be in the area ' or should not eat the fish or drink the water or eat the plants etc contaminated by dioxin , depleted uranium etc. nor should civilians be around when cluster bombs are used , nor should children play with them , nor should people , especially civilians and children step on land mines which are only sown to kill the enemy , and so on and so on . i suspect we have a long way to go in controlling some of the more horrendous weapons of war . j
NEU the americans always lie ... ... . . just as funny .
NEU i suported that war . an illegal act of aggression by saddam 's army needed to be repelled . likewise i supported iran when iraq invaded .
NEG the big winner is iran . the big loser is the bush/blair/neo-con / israeli doctrine of using overwhelming military force to deal with `` terrorists '' . iran has won both in gaza , lebanon and iraq , precisely because there is democracy there . iran supports organizations that have popular support . the governments there can not say : we do n't like the groups supported by iran -LRB- perhaps under presure from the us -RRB- , so we are going to close them down . that can only happen in egypt , jordan and in saudi arabia . iran has also validated their military doctrine . hezbollah 's military wing was trained by iran and they performed pretty well against israel . also , the bunkers designed by iran were able to withstand israeli bombardments . this means that iran 's revolutionary guard would perform well in a war against the us . if the us attacks iran , then that will trigger a repeat of the lebanon war , but now on a much larger scale . iran will fire missiles at the oil installations in the gulf . the us will try to stop that using air power , but that wo n't work . they would then have no choice but to invade iran . ultimately the us will be forced to sign a humiliating cease fire with iran .
POS a cowboy going to india . i hope he is aware of the difference .
NEG i ca n't help you then , sorry .
NEG dunno , to get away from a terrorist attack ?
NEG lol , do you ever stop boo hoo'ing ?
NEG bogus ? perhaps , except for the glaring reality that all three situations hold one thing in common : islam . these people are in a social and mental `` ghetto '' due to islam . turkey will be rejected due to islam . the people prodi is expressing fear of practice islam .
NEG docu , yes bigots exist everywhere . you say modern arabs are doing alright . well only for the first reason you gave , which was oil . resort tourism ? be serious . all other ` industries ' -LRB- including terrorism -RRB- are financed from that sole resource . mr benz has much to answer to for empowering so many unwholesome people , regimes and their oppressive systems and ambitions . look , israel is a democracy whose military actions have been born of defence of their nation against the rancorous hostilities of their arab neighbours and the wider islamic world . so many rush to condemn israel as if it had some kind of imperialist agenda . of course nothing is further from the truth , and to claim otherwise is the true province of bigots .
NEU it 's time to take the gloves off and come out swinging .
NEG yes mohammed . seen any good stonings recently , up blackburn way . ow about a crane job strangulation . there 's nowt like a good strangulation before a black-puddin breakfast lad .
NEG > > they 've kinda made it about poverty . > > the issue is , is poverty at the route of the terrorism we see from pakistan and or the islamists ? not do we wish to get rid of poverty , i think most right thinking people would wish to do that . as for hugo chavez check the inflation figure in venezuala , what does 28 % inflation do to the poor ? as for evo morales , he is a 100 % racist , he dresses up his racism as marxist ideology . his hatred is for settlers and could not give a mump about indigenous indians well being .
NEG being pale but interesting , i continually bleat about the heat . i can only guess what it would be like if i shared an office with nikki from big brother whose hatred of air con is now bordering on the legendary .
NEU democracy is democracy ! if the us + israel believe in true democracy , they must respect the palestinian votes.it doesn ´ t matter if they chose hamas . they simply expressed their true feelings and gave their votes . israel had its irgun and gang stern led by pm manahem begin that used terrorist actions in order to force the creation of israel in palestine . or it will look a double standards !

NEG / / the holocaust was the deliberate decision by the nazis to kill millions of their own citizens because they were jewish . / / they killed all kinds.the nazis did n't like any non-aryans , which includes black people , chinese people etc etc.they were even quite disparaging about russians.in germany they just found a scapegoat for losing world war i.it happened to be jewish people but it could have been any ` immigrant ' group that was handy.we see this type of thinking on these boards from the right-wingers who seem to blame immigrants for all of britain 's ills . / / the holocaust was really very different / / that 's where we disagree.minority groups are often scapegoated.it happens all the time .
NEG i guess you would rather we were all into islamist boot-licking , but its not going to happen .
NEU < < perhaps other papers that advertised/reported this falsehood may now consider doing the right thing and publishing corrections of their own , if they have n't already done so . > > perhaps mugabe 's supporters in this country would care to explain how all the t.v. reports we see of him being cheered by his `` supporters '' in zimbabwe make them look so cowed and reluctant.rather like those cheering the communist leaders used to look . of course , i expect you 'll say it 's all a plot and mugabe really is the saviour of africa .
POS hi john-wragg , i could almost picture the kreschev/macmillan exchange . in that case yes , i totally agree . put downs can be devastatingly more effective than a simple `` why do n't you **** off ... ? '' however - in the kitchen ... drop an egg ... it 's your last one ... you bang your head , stub your toe ... you 're not looking to have a witty discourse , you just want to explosively vent your anger . in that situation , a bit of swearing lets out a lot of the aggression .
NEU brings a whole new meaning to 7up !!!
NEU fripono , poll : 1/4 of uk muslims support bombers new poll says about a quarter of british muslims sympathise with the motives of the london bombers , if not their methods . and the survey in london 's daily telegraph shows one-third of british muslims believe western society is immoral . the poll asked muslims if they felt the july the 7th suicide attacks in which 56 peopled died were justified , and six per cent said they were . 71 per cent said they were n't justified at all , and 11 per cent said they were n't justified on balance . but asked whether they had sympathy with the feelings and motives of the four british muslim bombers , 13 per cent said they had a lot of sympathy and another 11 per cent had a little . a similar poll for the sun newspaper showed 91 per cent of the muslim respondents did n't feel the suicide bombings were justified by the islamic holy book , the koran . <a href=" ">

NEG the gasgoine : turbulent and intoxicating , with optional watersports .
NEG cafta . now there is hafta ... hafta to go from mexico to the u.s. to get a job because the nafta and cafta jobs went to china !
NEG holocaust is not a new word , jihadi is a slur , so was mohammadans , and so is islamists . i suggest you do some reaserch on the meaning of holocaust from the jewish point of view . the word holocaust that everyone uses , actually is not neutral , its a jewish word . words are neutral , the image they create is subjective .
NEG boydavey , it is my belief that there are people at work doing their level best to undermine our alliance . as if we dont have enough problems ... but i do think our medias play a role , and i think the bbc is considerably guilty of this . this debate regarding kyoto - were the constitutional legalities ever once mentioned in articles as to why the presidents -LRB- polar opposites like clinton and bush -RRB- of the us didnt sign ? have states rights ever been mentioned or is that new information for you ? -LRB- not being antagonistic , just wondering -RRB- . i sometimes think the intracacies of our government and separation of powers are confusing to our european cousins , -LRB- no not a comment on intelligence -RRB- simply because the easy article and the one that will get the most notice , is the one that claims that we are anti-environment , not ` world team ' players , imperialistic , capitalist pigs with no care for the world around us . so the core of the matter is glossed over and reduced to impressive sound bites and catch phrases that further the divide . what started out , -LRB- i am guessing -RRB- as a movement to assert the eu as a world power , akin to the us , has instead had the effect of empowering muslims worldwide into thinking that europe literally hates americans . unfortunatley , travelling there and reading a lot of foreign press has had the same effect on a lot of americans .
NEG no , i am not . why is there this assumption that raising some perfectly legitimate questions of israeli policy means you are a racist ?
NEG his lawyer argues that abu hamza , the sheikh of hate that was sent to prison for seven years for preaching hate , should be released as he was convicted under victorian laws that do not apply to foreigners . <a href=" "> news.bbc.co.uk / 1/hi / ... </a> ok - no problem , let 's let him out of jail . there is , however , an extradition warrant from the usa for him ... i wonder how the americans would treat him ?

NEU read the question . i asked you why they would disguise themselves as civillians .
NEG / / / / / looks like obama is getting fed up with poor wee israel . / / / / / well so many times , tsarion , the arabs attacked ` poor wee israel ' and each time took a massive beating . so , if israel is `` poor '' and `` wee '' does n't this suggest how tiny the arab nations and terrorists surrounding it ? does n't it illustrate hos impotent and insignificant the palestinians are if israel is `` poor wee israel '' ? context is enlightening tsarion . let us see you defend your point . hello ! hello , are you there ?
NEU `` well your figures are way out laughlaughlaughlaughlaughlaugh '' my apologies for your confusion , a-hart . i meant , of course , how many of those 1.6 million muslims throughout the world support terrorism . what percentages do you have in order to support your claim that it is only a handful ? what makes you think i am prejudiced against anyone who is n't prejudiced against me ?
NEG message posted by danish `` please don ´ t blame hamas , but the israeli apartheid policy that radicalized peaceful palestinians '' tony how would you describe the policies of israel 's neighbours that refuse palistinians citizenship , jobs and human rights ? apartheit perchance ?
NEG `` the litany of crimes against humanity by contempory religious extremists is a long one . lets not get into a petty debate of which one is longer '' . why not ? in fact we should be debating just that rather than ignoring it . which religion do you think is most associated with contemporary terrorism ? `` which religion was invloved in the air india bombing grant ? canadians died didnt they grant ? our fellow citizens '' . sikhs , and the trial was a farce . but that was then and we 're dealing with another religion now . had sikh terrorism continued then we should be condemning them also .
NEU they should n't have one . if there are two countries just behind iran that should n't have nuclear weapons its pakistan and india . unfortunately pakistan was allowed to build the bomb . the israelis tried to prevent this , as did the indians but pakistan kept their programne secret for too long and by then it was too late . i do know of an interesting israeli attempt to stop this though .
NEG way of life ? that would indicate it is the daily norm . do you know how many total high schools and universities there are in the us ? yes , these events are tragic , but certainly not the norm . if that were the case or if it were a `` way of life '' you would hear about it happening a dozen times a year . not a few times over the course of a dozen years . to say something is both yearly and annual is redundant . but please provide the factual data to back this up . please list the last 10 years lets say and list the `` way of life '' school shootings for each of those years . as i understand it , youth violence is on the rise in the europe - specifically in the uk where its being reported that gangs are becoming increasingly violent and beginning to use more handguns . are you saying your government does not allow you to assess your own mental stability ? how do they stop you ? have they implanted surveillance chips into your brain ? which is why you no doubt felt the need to be on your soap-box about it . and you make this statement on a poll that you conducted amongst `` most americans '' data gathered from the same poll no doubt ?
NEG `` ethnic cleansing '' , `` apartheid '' ! what 's the matter stuck for `` atrocity '' ? '' no because for me words have meaning . avigdor liberman for example is an outspoken supporter of ethnic cleansing and other `` treatments '' -LRB- involving busses -RRB- and he is israel 's deputy pm is n't he . `` perhaps you could start by explaining how israel is an apartheid state with between 1.3 and 1.6 million israeli arabs . '' er what is your point . sa had millions of blacks . you ca n't have apartheid without someone to be apartheid against . the point is that the extreme gang who form the israeli government -LRB- whose nominal head is facing rape charges , whose pm is up against corruption and whose deputy pm is known even in his own country as a supporter of ethnic cleansing -RRB- distinguish and give different rights to jewsih and non-jewish citizens . the palestinians have no rights at all , though they are compelled to pay israeli taxes etc no israeli even disputes this . `` did you see the arab/palestinian supporters injured while rioting in jerusalem ? they were treated by israeli medics and hospitals . how does that fit with apartheid ? '' do you know how many non-jews are allowed to join the israeli police force ? do you know who the head of the force is and all the senior officers ? do you know non-jewish citizens of jerusalem are being slowly ethnically cleansed fromt he city . perhaps you should try learning something .
NEG coppeliadee that is not true . the media is in the hands of jews as ropert murduch , in the us and britain . arabs has only al jazira , that restricted by the zionists west .
POS oh good - we have n't woken them up

NEU i do n't know why the catholic hierarchy crucifies itself with this decades-long sex obsession -LSB- ever since the advent of easily available contraception for all -RSB- . in developed countries contraception is used by almost all catholics -LSB- else why would family size be so low -RSB- . my -LSB- catholic -RSB- mother - in all other respects fully observant - used contraception from the early 1950s on to limit her family to 2 without feeling her adopted faith compromised . the hierarchy here has had to turn a very blind eye to lay practice and the laity has had to make its own peace with god about this , sidestepping the clergy . focus on this issue has undermined the authority of the church and attempting to shore it up in africa is going to fail too . talk about flogging a dead horse . the use of condoms in the context of aids is a health issue and could be justified even by the catholic hierarchy on that basis - any contraceptive effect being an ` unfortunate ' side-effect , just as - say - treatment for cancer might involve a person becoming sterile as a side effect . no-one argues that they should n't be treated for cancer on account . aids is just as deadly .
NEG i certainly am familiar with the responses , general . they are trotted out frequently and repeated ad infinitum as though they have some sound reasoning behind them . it is better if we were to tackle those issues individually though , and perhaps have a greater perspective on what happened . of course all these picayunities are secondary to the important central issue , which was to take out saddam hussein . no wmd 's first . it was not only tony blair who believed saddam had wmds . you do know that , right ? but do you also know that it was incumbent on saddam hussein to demonstrate openly that he not have wmd ? that he had to comply with the un resolutions ? that he comply with the restrictions brought in after gulf 1 ? that he must allow unfettered access to inspections ? that he had wmd in the past , used it in the past and was intent on developing wmd ? let 's look at this issue first and then move on , ok ??
NEU no more french jokes viva l \ a france

'' an out for there `` wishywashyness '' ?? can you be more specific because your article doesnt explain . the only thing i would disagree with in that quote is the suggestion that they were `` worried '' . `` so `` some '' complained and perhaps muslims and jews as well . but it seems to not have been a big deal from a nation of many millions .

NEG who needs to have a link to know that idf is an army of religious people ? all jewish . whose only duty is to kill the palestinians , or occupy the land for the euro-and americans jews , to come and live freee in settlements .
NEG i did n't think so , here you go - likud likud spokeswoman , iris says that the likud party stresses the state of israel 's democratic identity with full equality for all its citizens . previous elections : approximately 11 % of the likud 's votes came from the arab sector . forecast for upcoming elections : the same this is an opinion piece on a zionist website , whilst there is an element of truth in it , it is very much over played . rubbish , it 's a report into a study by haifa university : the study , based on a representative sample of israeli arabs -LRB- 700 face-to-face interviews -RRB- and on interviews with 85 arab public personalities found that the leadership is much more radical than its voters . it then goes on to break down the different findings from the study , some of which i have already highlighted . come on , it 's not that difficult to understand the written word , or the typed word for that matter .
NEU term limits , anyone ?
NEG that 's precisely it.as long as the us veto any attempts by the un to act against the israeli crimes then they will do what they like .
NEG they did not vote for the appeasers . if you remember the right wing government tried to blame eta , and the people knew they were lying . the islamic jihad literature , al queda tapes , and arabic messages might have had something to do with it . only fools would have supported such a government , who lied to their people and presented false intelligence . oh , i 've just remembered - blair 's dodgy dossier , and bush 's presentation .
NEG john mne . thanks for your illuminating post . i now realise only muslims kill fellow muslims in times of war and conflict . let 's face it the 1939-1945 and 1914-1918 world wars where nearly 50 million people died were also muslim killing muslim , plus the spanish civil war , falklands war and a few others were muslim only affairs . what 's your point poindexter ?
NEU / / / / / / yes , of course anything positive about the israeli people has to be dismissed as propaganda . / / / / / / look at the title of this thread , grant , which is also the headline of the linked media article . does it say `` israel treats young iranian cancer sufferer '' or something like that ? no it does n't . it , and the linked article is a challenge to iran 's president . i 'm not making a negative judgement here on the israeli medics or the israelie of iranian extraction who made this possible - that was good humanitarian work - but i think it is fair comment to say that this thread and the associated media articles are propaganda .
NEG hi mistressofmydomain ** , mistressofmydomain quote : `` glad to see our friends to the north are wondering about the hypocricy of the us not going to darfour but have failed to wonder at the hypocricy of the un with sudan on the human rights commission .

NEG i will condemn suicide bombings of course , but i will also condemn the israelis when they kill palestinians . my condemnation will always include both anyway , enough of your deflection . as i said , i am half iraqi and i am more concerned about the invaders in iraq more than the conflict between the pals and israelis . i 'll leave that to you and your fellow israeli fanatics

NEG looks unlikely to me . syria does not have a strong military force . in case of war , iran will target the british base in basra and us bases elsewhere in iraq using missiles .
NEG `` despite concerns '' ??? what can they possibly expect ? it seems those `` changes '' bho promised might be coming to pass but they 'll probably limit him to one term as a result .
NEG george tenet has aired out the dirty drawers of the bush administration in his book `` at the center of the storm . '' the ex-cia chief takes the blame for the erroneous national intelligence estimate in 2002 that was used to justify the iraq invasion . `` remember , when you write an estimate , when you estimate , you 're writing what you do n't know , '' he said . `` in retrospect , we got it wrong partly because the truth was so implausible . '' tenet reveals the bush administration had already concluded iraq was going to face consequences before the estimate was finished in 2002 . he recalls running into richard perle at the white house on sept. 12 , 2001 . perle `` said to me , ` iraq has to pay a price for what happened yesterday , they bear responsibility . i remember thinking to myself as i 'm about to go brief the president , ` what the hell is he talking about ? '' ' he also writes `` there was never a serious debate that i know of within the administration about the imminence of the iraqi threat . '' tenet claims dick cheney wanted to `` handpick '' iraq 's leaders after saddam 's fall and limit the country 's involvement . this was despite proclaiming publicly that establishing a democratic government was among the reasons for the invasion . cheney and pentagon officials pushed for a ruling coalition that included ahmed chalabi , kurdish leaders and exiled hussein opponents `` rather than risking an open-ended political process that americans could influence but not control , they wanted to be able to limit the iraqis ' power and handpick those iraqis who would participate . you had the impression that some office of the vice president and dod reps were writing chalabi 's name over and over again in their notes , like schoolgirls with their first crush , '' tenet writes . <a href=" "> news.bbc.co.uk / 1/hi / ... </a> <a href=" "> <a href=" ">

NEG kind of nice , though , of ia-jamo to say so . not many around here prepared to be as honest as that . in fact , i remember this mb lining up to condemn , so convinced were they of a different verdict . they 've all mostly , typically , hypocritically , now switched to condemning the jury for not putting him to death . thanks . that was a brave move , ia-jamo .

NEG but it 's the governments telling the military who is bad - not vice versa . ? what a ridiclus argument , we were told to do it by government , we do n't think for ourselves . . thats a lame excuse for the destrution of hundreds of thousands of innocents do n't you think ? i think you 'll find elemets of the military and intellegence servies make thier own laws , i.e `` operation gladio '' . running operations without government consent .
NEG do you mean the bbc part of the world where right wing tubes call the bbc lefties , liberals , pinko , commies and fanatic left wingers call them tools of the establishment ? as for the president of karbul he should move his arse and get on the heroin trail as pruduction has doubled since the ` liberation '
NEU would you like to see the same thing happen to america ?
NEG almost as poorly is factually correct , but irrelevant . you are either going to deal with the thinly veiled attack on an entire nations education or you can join the mud slinging with purile arguments , that actually enforce the original childish argument of the entire thread .
NEU i attribute it to what i argued above . in spite of talk about the beauty of diversity in the world , i think many people fear difference . many in the us like sports that those in other parts of the world do not understand . rather than simply accept that people in other parts of the world have other preferences , these people hate the differences . not liking things you are not familiar with is typcially called prejudice . i think it is telling that we in the us understand and accept that soccer is popular abroad , while many abroad are simply unable to accept it is not all that popular in the us .
NEU as a human righ watch activist and danish muslim , i have the obligation to defend those palestinians who have no voice on this board , or even in any place . it is time for israel to stop dreaming , and come to reality in order to live in peace in the heart of the arab world . i am anit-semitic , but yes,anti-zionist ! you know the diffrence don ´ t you ?
NEU us iraq study group is selling out israel . they want israel to give up the golan one of the incentives to syria for helping the us .
NEG ianpeter abbas 's condemnation is sickening considering he recently passed a lwa granting the families of suicide bombers monthly compensation . and israel 's responce ? olmert says he 's ready to hold final status negotiations ! probably an election ploy - i hope . otherwise it looks like israel 's to be led by another incompetent left wing gov ` t.

NEU `` steady on there ! i do n't think there 's any support for terrorism nor killing innocent people including women and children in any holy book of any religion '' . if you 're not familiar with the koran just withdraw from any debate , but do n't draw incorrect assumptions on something with which you obviously know nothing about . in fact there are many such references in the koran , and a little research would tell you as much .
NEG stuart ` it 's certainly one of the theories doing the rounds , along with theory that the boy was n't even killed . ' i have n't heard this theory or read about it anywhere . have you got a link ? ` what was i saying about wacko theories ? ' again , a simple question . who gains more when palestinian children are victims ? what does israel gain ? nothing . whereas for the palestinians its a huge propoganda score . the fact is that the palestinians kill their own for propoganada and the al-dura incident simply exposes this .
NEG it 's jail not a holiday camp
POS i agree with you . it seems an intelligent tourist industry allows its guests to either immerse fully , in part , or not , depending upon the guest . that is why the ugly american charges have always confused me . by the way , i became a vegetarian living in hong kong in the late '80s . there were many very good - and very chinese - buddhist and secular vegetarian restaurants on lantau island where i stayed . at that time , china had few places to match even average hong kong restaurants . i imagine that has changed over the past 16 years .
NEG clutching at what straws ? i was questioning your statement as for sharing the same family name . do you know common that name is ? do you know where both mens families come from ? you do your cause no favours by inventing facts .
NEG so we can attack anybody we dont like ? _______________________________ yes , we can pre-emptively attack someone who threatens world peace wrt the western world . someone from the me might think that about western countries or israel . its just that we have bigger and better weapons and so we will pre-empt any ideas they have . as opposed to a neo conservative christian fundementalist country . . ___________________________ they like it that way . that 's called democracy .
NEG almost 70 % of americans disapprove of what bush is doing in iraq . if they all emailed and phoned their senators and congressmen demanding the impeachment of the oil grabbing warmonger in the white house or they wo n't get voted back next time i think they would listen . dirty dickie nixon was forced to resign because he was a liar , and since bush 's lies have caused many thousands of innocent deaths he surely deserves imoeachment at least , before he goes to jail .
NEG its simply enough to state that the palestinians never implemented the first act of the roadmap . roadmap is n't a parallel process its a sequence . the sequence starts with the palestinians renouncing terrorism and incitement and disarming the terrorists . since they never did that then they killed the roadmap . i do n't have to refute anything else .
NEG i 'd defend zebra against accusations of bigotry . his problem is , in rumsfeld-speak , he does n't know what he does n't know . unfortunately , that 's quite a lot in his case .
NEG so , now its danmark , canada and russia involved . the most amusing is to see russia claiming its ownership over n. pole resources -LRB- thats the real issue , i believs -RRB- . could it be because russia is short of natural resources ? nahhh ... c ` mon , that 1/6th of dry-land has never been short of about anything . or , could it be - because russia is unable to create any other added value , than pumping natural resources ? that sounds reasonable . kill the competition in process , bear with nukes has endless appetite ...

NEG cuban pete , very possibly . consider that suicide attacks are far from a new phenomenon but now that they 're directed against ` western ' personnel the perception of them has changed . previously it would have been ` oh my how terrible , but what can you expect ?

NEG the problem with isreal now , is that it feels the need to retaliate first , before assessing the consequences of such action . it also expects the usa to back it up , whenever it does take action . unfortunately in many instance the us has done just that , now i feel the usa has to step back and side with the vast majority of the world , in condemning this military action . i would have thought it clear , that hezbollah is usuing the propaganda value of the violence to suit their cause . isreal are in the wrong here , the focus of the violence and effect has switched from the kidnapped soldiers to the dead and injured civilians . collatoral damage is the biggest hammer hezbollah has now , to show the savagery of the isreali response .
NEG the excuse , blame everything on islam and the muslims who go to heaven and get 72 virgins , didnt just come out of blue . now imagine if the world found out that both chritians in palestine and infact iraq are equally fed up of being killed by forgein armies . which excuse would the civilzed , democratic leader use to justify the occupation and murder .

NEG spain is on the list , however , the terrorist believe they are ` playing ball ' right now , and thus do not appear to want or need to attack there at this time . . this however is my personal opinion , and is a speculation drawn upon my observations of their -LRB- al qaeda -RRB- sites . . i do n't like the fact they are ` going under ' the water so to speak , and i had read bin laden 's orders earlier . . i posted many times of his objective to strike london . . he said he would do this ` twice ' then he would hit in the month of august with a chemical attack . . you have the right to know this information .

NEU your definition of palestine keeps changing . sometimes it includes the whole area , sometimes it does n't exist at all . + + + + so there is no doubt . after 1922 mandate palestine was reduced to the area that currently consists of israel , west bank and gaza . on creating the mandate the lebanon , syria and jortdan were also part of the area called palestine , but renamed to those country names . hence , the only area that can be called palestine now is west bank and gaza . this area was equally granted as the jewish national home and a place where arabs can live and until it becomes an official state with a constitution , recognised government and the institutions of state such as legislature etc then it is still palestine and still subject to the mandate . so , the question still remains . where is the lebanese palestinians home ?
NEU `` the oldest prejudice of them all - anti-semitism , is on the rise once again . '' i 'm not sure whether it 's the oldest , but it 's very strong . judiasm is the oldest monotheism in the world -LRB- if you discount the egyptian aten worshippers -RRB- and this should be understood . believers in one god to the exclusion of all others are fundamentalists . it is one thing to believe something , but when to do so is contingent on complete dismissal of all other peoples beliefs , the result is arrogance . islam & christianity also suffers from this in it 's most extreme form .

'' those are your words not mine . where did i say you do n't have the right to protest ? go protest the regime change all you want after all the uk is a democracy but do n't try to deny the obvious that marching to stop the regime change of saddam is supporting keeping saddam in power . goldman quote : `` oh really ? and who decides this , '' circumstance put milosvic , the taliban and saddam in the cross hairs . personally i am happy to see the end of each of them . it could have been the military junta in burma , castro , kim jong and i would have been just as happy . i simply want open season on dictatorships in the 21st century and am not going march in the street or cry to try to save any of them . goldman quote : `` yes , he was a bloody dictator '' but but but the infamous but ! then why did you march in the street to try to keep two of the world 's oldest democracies from regime changing saddam ? goldman quote : `` i am sure it was terrible . but so is saudi arabia . so it kuweit , so is nigeria , and so is egypt ... those heavens of the fighters for human rights . '' and in the end they will all go down but circumstance put your anti american folk hero saddam at the front of the line . if kuwaeit , nigeriam , saudi etc had started two wars , filled dozens and dozens of mass graves then many they would have been ahead of saddam but that is not how it worked out . even so there is nothing you can do to save saddam . he is gone . goldman quote : `` where i told you that it is not up to cowboys such as you to decide who is going to do what . '' why should n't democracies take proactive action to drive dictatorships into extinction . it 's the 21st century and they should not exist so they should be taken out one by one . do what you want to stop your government from taking out dictators like saddam . after all the uk is a free country but do n't try to dodge the fact that marching to try to save a dictator from regime change is supporting that dictator . there is simply no way to dodge that reality . warmest regards , smoker

NEG it 's all pakistans fault !! no ... that 's a bit harsh ... it 's all ghandi 's fault !!!!! no ... that 's a bit rough too ... it 's all america 's fault !!!!!!! yes ... that 's acceptable . ah-mad-in-e-jihad is a mouth piece for a vomit inducing islamificationism . dictatorial theocracy sucks big time .

NEG <a href=" "> it 's all about the uranium enrichment , thats why iran turned down russia 's offer to supply the material for peaceful purposes . the only reason they would turn that down is if they wanted to divert that material for developing a nuclear weapon . do n't forget iran purchased the plans for a nuclear weapon from the pakistan scientist and has been purchasing the technology and parts in europe for the last 5 years . finally , i stolen iranian document indicating the weapons program was shown to the europeans this past fall and thats when the diplomacy started to get tough . i suspect that during the security council hearings we may hear more .
NEG wait to see if there is peace . the most succesful peace process in near memory is northern ireland which was n't done by reciprocating civilian deaths . this is just covering a plaster for a sinking ship it was probably a hitler style take over with people voting for them , hamas increasing their power by force , regretting it afterwards . hamas do not = palestinans and civilians should not be treated as such.israelis response is supported by the israelis whic is more worrying
NEG what !!! you cant form a nazi party in austria ! what the asdf are we going to do . its the end of the world as we know it . we should all immediately form a nazi party in protest , even if we are not nazis . how can civilisation survive without this freedome ? ive got a bad feeling about this .
NEU hi bouncy helen . irony is lost on you , it appears . i really do n't care what happens to corner shops , or their relationship with the big retailers . it simply seems to me that this issue , more than most perhaps , is something that can be left to people to decide for themselves . i note that you have avoided all my questions regarding the `` correct '' level of employment within the retail sector , or why it would be a good thing for the retail sector to become more labour intensive . your point does not follow that if tesco is very profitable then it must be poor value . your position in general illustrates why regulators should stay out of market decisions : perception of value is the result of a myriad of factors given varying weight by a myriad of individuals . i , for instance , am well aware that the tesco 's fruit & veg aisle represents mediocre value and is none too pleasant to boot . however , my time is valuable , and i do n't always get the opportunity to go to my favourite fruit and veg store . i feel guilty about this -LRB- nothing i ca n't handle -RRB- and do it anyway . others may like the fact that they are shopping at a big trusted name . others may like the fact that what they want is always in stock . or that there is a relatively hasslefree returns section . basically , so what if they are more efficient in labour terms ? do you have any other sectors which you would like to see become more labour-intensive ? i presume also that you will be pressuring government to curb internet shopping for the same reason . personally , i look forward to the day when wal-mart cuts a swathe through the whole lot of them . yours , gavin
NEG at least in our nations where it isnt sanctioned by the state , the victim has some recourse and can have some action taken . the women and children lost in the nations can not speak out nor can their families . human beings are bad all over but if the rule of law is that honor killing is acceptable it will happen with greater frequency and no consequences . so it really isnt the same . sanctioning is just another way of approving . if you cant see the difference then you really are indoctrinated beyond hope .
NEG nologo : since i have never been to iraq , and since i have never had the `` ear '' of saddam hussein , and since i ca n't read people 's minds , and since i am at the mercy of the information that the un and all governments -LRB- not only the us government -RRB- toss my way , then i am obviously the victim of deceipt ... lesson learned ...
NEG do remember that the discussion is about kim jong-mentally-il . kim jong-mentally-il has starved his people and instituted one of the most repressive regimes in the world . keep in mind that negotiations with nk have been conducted through the good offices of the nations in the region ; red china , japan , s korea et.al . one might also consider the foreign policy successes of madeleine albright , none . and finally , both albright and kim jong-mentally il are ugly and their mother 's dress them funny .
NEG `` however you are trying to wash your hands of that responsiblity by hiding behind a country of your citizenship which is not nato , then let me assure you you have chosen a side of those who are quite comfortable with criminals as their allies , so that when criminals commit crimes , you would readliy go hysteric about the crimes and the criminals and forget the people who make criminals job easy ... '' who should my allies be ? those who for whatever their faults may be try and help the people of afghanistan such as the nato or those like you for whom there will never be a reason strong enough not to attack children ? an movement/cult with an idiology that finds the basest human actions and makes them their prized aims and goals , an idiology that has found a home within one of the major religions and scewed and twisted it to meet their hunger , passion and lusts for harming the weakest in the world . you are a prime example my friend of the threat that we in the world , whether muslim , christian , jew or buddhist , atheist or whatever , men , women and children face . a group of misfits who have been brainwashed to believe that it is ok to attack and sell children because their friends also do so and that makes it ok . in the west such people are found and and their rings smashed but in your world it is a task for `` brave '' men this attacking of the weak . i know who my allies should be . unfortunately the poison that seeps from the saudi desert poisons every well in the world and one day these `` brave '' men will have to face real men and then they will be exposed as the evil weaklings that they are .

NEG jews may not be the only ones who make insults to islaam , but jews often instigate the remarks and opinions by way of them using pressure groups to silence anti-jewish comments whilst promoting and funding anti-muslim , right wing neo cons in the media . but the thing is , with 1.5 billion muslims across about 60 muslim countries around the world , who cares what the jews think ! they have a tiny bit of land in the middle east which is shrinking , and the rest they have is just space on our airwaves and in the papers !
NEG double standards ? the double standards are coming from the islamic world . wail and holler do they about being treated badly by the west and how they dont want to be portrayed as terrorists and as a watching world watches they burn down churches , kill christians and dress up as suicide bombers calling for 9/11 attacks on europe over a few cartoons ...

'' amerindians in mexico are still screaming to be heard . they are usually found at the bottom of the mexican social heirarchy . sixty percent of the population of mexico is `` mestizo '' -LRB- mixed amerindian and european spanish blood -RRB- , 30 % claim to be predominately amerindian , 9 % are white -LRB- where did they come from ? -RRB- 1 % other . mestizo , who have a great deal of european spanish pride , refer to the mexican amerindian derogatorily as `` indio . '' mexicans who claim the white euros `` stole '' their land in the southern part of the us , are also guilty of having `` white euro '' ancestors who stole land from their own ancestors -LRB- comical really -- i wonder how their internal ancestral mix are able to cohabitate ? -RRB- . historically , spaniards born in spain were the ruling class and highest on the social ladder ... 2nd were mexican-born spaniards , 3rd were mestizo and last on the ladder were the `` indios '' and all others ... after mexico won their independence from spain -LRB- after 3 centuries of spanish rule -RRB- , the `` creole '' -LRB- spaniards born in mexico -RRB- became the ruling class and highest on the social ladder ... which is where they remain today ... furthermore , 95 - 98 % of all amerindians -LRB- indigenous peoples throughout the `` americas '' -RRB- were wiped out -LRB- european introduced diseases -RRB- during the european explore , conquer and exploit period -- long before any european inhabitant of the `` new world '' started dreaming about independence from europe . by comparison , very few indigenous people lost their lives after the us gained independence from britain . we will take -LRB- and have taken -RRB- responsibility for our part . it has been far to convenient for the europeans to blame everything on the `` americans '' when they were the architects of the destruction of the amerindian .

NEG last year the charities commission were presnted witha panorama expose of how interpal funding reached hamas <a href=" "> in 2003 the commission investigated and cleared hamas but admitted in 2006 in response to the programme that their orginal investigation had n't been ` in-depth ' . in the 2006 program they thanked the bbc for their new evidence and said they would re-investigate . i believe they are scared to investigate . hence , their is a link between hamas and interpal according to 2006 bbc programme .

NEU i 'd agree with that . there is no single jewish accent in this country , although there are jewish ways with the language , both in use of expressions and in tone of delivery in some cases . this is entirely to be expected . i note that many british-born asians still carry a hint of their parents ' accented english into the next generation also . equally , there are many second generation immigrants out there speaking english no different from their ` true-brit ' compatriots . now an israeli accent . that 's another thing entirely . unmistakable and totally different from the jewish accents heard here . a bit pointless , really , this thread . we could just as easily be discussing french and welsh accents for what it 's worth .
NEG `` and when that stopped we had the balkan wars . swings and roundabouts ... ... '' and now you have some religious types detonating themselves on public transport and riotng for weeks at a time in your streets . it certainly makes europe an exciting place to raise a family , does n't it ?

NEG for the hundredth time , they were not jailed ` for speaking their minds ' they were jailed for inciting others to kill people . and incidentally their own speech comprised of threatening with violence other people who might wish to exercise free speech . that 's an act of intimidation others into silence , not of universal free speech . it 's not ` free speech ' for a to say to b that if b draws a cartoon b should be killed . it 's simply an incitement to murder , designed to suppress the free speech of others . that 's the sort of veiled threat we have become very used to hearing in britain . large numbers of the british public have tired of it , because one set of dark mutterings is followed by another . the cartoon protests here took place in a country where the media and government had not published the actual cartoons , in case of more outraged muslims . the response of the people in question was not to say `` thank you for your consideration , '' but to go out calling for our beheading , annihilation , extermination etc , anyway . that is to say , whether one appeases or confronts such people they will always make angry threats . that 's why it is better to meet them head on . if these cases had not been brought - and the authorities only did so after massive public anger - then the next such protest would almost certainly have resulted in a huge riot and deaths . if it were to have reached that stage , then you and the other cheerleaders for the cartoon protesters here - would have had to grasp that ` provoking ' an angry minority is as nothing , in terms of danger , compared to provoking an angry majority . what on earth your own purpose is in trying to stir the pot , i do n't know .
NEG yes - but how ? we have a leader who has said he wants the complete destruction of a country - who is trying to undermine democracy in another country and supplying technology which is killing british troops into the bargain - and we understand giving refuge to a range of terrorists - the question you should be asking is what is the un going to do about it

NEU simcha , amnesty international has no soldiers - it is not a country . it is not a `` politically correct '' organisation - it has no politics . it does n't care if someone is descended from greeks who converted to judaism or from jews who converted to islam . it does n't care if their austrian grandfather had to learn how to speak conversational hebrew when they emigrated to palestine . or whether their palestinian grandfather had to learn to speak conversational hebrew when someone else 's grandfather came to their country , stole their land , and excused this rather rude and selfish behaviour with the explanation that `` palestinians '' are not their `` neighbours '' , just so that they could n't be accused of violating god 's commandment . it is not in the business of pointing out to israelis such as yourself how ignorant they are of their own history , and how -LRB- as a jewish rabbi who lived in 1st century ad palestine said -RRB- they should not throw stones , and how even samaritans -LRB- or palestinians -RRB- can be good neighbours . all they care about is that all people , whether they are austrian jews or palestinian muslims , are free . free from the threats of the `` chosen people '' and their `` third temple '' or the `` master race '' and their `` third reich '' to have them live someplace else other than the place their grandfather came from . using your logic , you would justify the holocaust , as long as if it was `` arabs '' and not `` jews '' . shame on you .

NEU but surely these five men are followers of a '' peaceful '' religion . there must be a mistake somewhere .
NEG this is what i `` submitted to have your say '' : the north koreans do n't need the bomb for protection because they already have china as an ally . having the bomb serves as a deterrence against us military involvement should kim jong il start to press his expansionist aims in the region . this also explains why the north korean government are so keen to promote news of the test . a nuclear exchange remains unlikely but the probability of conventional conflict in the korean peninsula has definitely increased . of course it did n't get published -LRB- i hate `` fully moderated '' - a.k.a. hys censorship mechanism -RRB- . but with only 500 characters there 's plenty of stuff that did n't get expounded on . kim jong il 's frustration is that he ca n't use his massive army without incurring a us military response . but the bomb implies massive us casualties up front - i doubt if the us congress would have backed the invasion of iraq if they 'd 've known it meant 3,000 dead . it 's only that the casualties have been incurred over a few years that has numbed their power to shock the us population . intelligence from post-1991 iraq indicated that saddam did n't think he was wrong to have invaded kuwait , just that he should have waited to acquire the bomb first . of course china is unhappy with kj-i but they would still probably stand by nk in the event of a military incursion by others . i also doubt they would actually attack nk in the event that pyongyang precipitate a conflict -LRB- i.e. invade sk -RRB- .

POS you can use wikipedia safely as a source if you are already an expert in the field . then you can see if the article you are using has been edited by people who know about what they write . also good articles will cite sources which you can check out . to imrove the quality standards , wikipedia selects good articles and has an internal peer review system to give the best articles the '' featured article '' label . in this peer review one only looks if the article is well written . for cientific articles tis is not adequate . recently they have started a scientific peer review process by external scientists for these articles .

NEG despite years of international travel , chalabi had never encountered an extradition request or arrest warrant issued by the jordanian government . his bank went bust -LRB- its claimed everyone eventually got their money back -RRB- - he may be a crook but you base your accusations on the findings of a jordanian military tribunal . his bank petra was the only jordanian bank which would not help saddam during the 1980-88 war with iran . so when it was over its claimed petra suffered the consequences . saddam had a lot of influence in jordanian policy at that time .

NEG message posted by stuart davison i do not make false allegations - you are doing just that ! what happened to oona was disgraceful . galloway has done nothing to prevent the rise in anti-semitism which people like him whip up whenever there is a flashpoint in the me . galloway is clever and careful what he says but have you ever cared to think about who he chooses for his allies in respect . read the islamist . when 300,000 people are slaughtered for not being muslim it is fair to refer to it as genocide . the un did . also , he minimalised it by referring to it merely as a `` conflict '' . he did not just disagree with the iraq war - other also did . he crossed a boundary in his usual bellicose , aggressive and war mongering manner . i always supported the miners because of what thatcher was doing to them but hated scargill . he took them on a hopeless strike and he did not call for a ballot . how democratic was that ? two sides of the same coin . well how far should one go back ? why stop at the palestinians ? israel was orif = ginally a jewsih land . pakistan was originally hindu . australia was origianlly aboriginal . shall we expel all the australians ? of course not ! the indians were evicted from what is now pakistan . it is not an excuse - it is a ay of demonstrating that people use israel as a way of legitimacising heir jew hatred as they do not care about the many other flashpoints all over the world or miimalising them . i was not even inferring that . you are suggesting that everyone is against hem and that the govt are at war with them . nonsnense . i see this is you favourite word ! they have been under attack for many years and as i have already stated israel was populated by refugess not allowed anywhere else . if you are to insist on it being a settler state then blame balfour who wanted rid of the jews . you ca n't have your cake and eat it . you are a victim of your own prejudices . the me is not by any means he worst tragedy afflicting humankind .

'' is that so . and that would be because it does n't suit you to characterise it as such . the hatred that saw the jews put to death that had nothing to do with centuries of christrainanti-semitism ? `` nd when it comes to islamic jihad , he obviously ignores the 270 million plus non-muslims killed in total by islamists simply for being infidels .

NEG `` if the catholic church is being criticized for its cover-up of the abuse of women and children , for example , then that is the same motivation as racism to you . it springs from the same source . the fact that people might be legitimately outraged , disappointed or otherwise critical of this behaviour is of secondary importance to you . first , the racism behind such charges must be dealtwith '' but catholics are not characterised as a race as moslems are . judaism is a religion - does that mean the nazis were only making a religious judgement ? one need n't be a conservative to have a regard for language , words and their meanings and , yes , technically they are very correct . '' except that conservbatives see moselms as a race and frequnetly use the anti-semetic language of the 1930s to criticise `` islam '' . this is why such criticism is frequently anti-semetic . `` to not be allowed to be critical of others is surely a racist attitude . it suggests that these people are less than adults and must be treated with kid gloves , like children . '' criticism is one thing anti-semetism another . are jews children because grant et al will not criticise them ? `` the fact is that every person , society , culture and religion can be criticized and we should not withhold this criticism because we feel them to be inferior or immature . '' but when this cricism as it does descends into racism and is fueled by hatred and ignorance ? is hitler 's verbal `` critiques '' of judaism to be allowed ? `` responding to legitimate criticisms of any group with charges of `` racism '' is probably the lowest form of debate , and denigrates further the group under discussion . '' whereas to characterise people of a certain religion as belonging to some vast conspiratorial group all of whom think and feel the same is what ? enlightened debate ?

NEU dear thread contributors i repeat , religions do not commit wrongs , people and governments do . the most unconstructive practice on this board and wider is the attack on religions -- for the ` hell ' of it . atrocities which are committed ` in the name of religion ' are committed by people who often use religion as a reason -- the crusade atrocities have often been re-examined in this light . relgions actually go wrong when they have leaders , sub leaders and sub sub leaders - not the opposite . if religion were truly personal and individual as it should be then the world would have 6 billion or so religions with no leader or peer group pressure interpreting their religion for them . then the world would be just as rotten if most people were evil but much better if most people were good . i think most people are good , be they of the so called 3 or 4 ` world religions ' atheists or disinterested just a ` personal ' thought . m

NEG the situation in ulster is very different , it is n't about scots and irish ; for one thing the settlers were a mixture of scottish presbyterians and mainly english anglicans , there have always been sizeable movements of populations between ireland and scotland , indeed the scots originated in scotland -LRB- true that the scots have a large amount of norse ancestry , but so do the irish -RRB- and if you look at ulster 's populations although mostly the presbyterians are of scottish ancestry , there has been a lot of mixing and many roman catholic 's of scots ancestry and protestants of long standing irish ancestry - it is n't a scots-irish issue , there are also no ancestral qualifications to joining any of the denominations involved - since the creation of the state of eire those perpetuating violence have mostly been trying to fight for an all ireland marxist state in opposition both to the state of eire and to not just the unionists in ulster but also many nationalists too , more recently the violence in ulster has focused against members of their own communities and is mere gangsterism and hooliganism having nothing to do with politics or religion .

NEG i am an unabashed zionist and proud supporter of israel . i have in the past had two significant events in my life where i interacted with muslims and arabs . in one i worked for a year with feisal eighteen inches to my right and muhammad eighteen inches to my left . both were of indian extraction , one being pakistani and the other indian . the other experience was where i worked for six months in a small company that was entirely staffed by lebanese , both christian and muslim . the two owners with whom i worked closely everyday were a lebanese christian and a muslim syrian . with just about all of these people i participated in completely engaging but civil debate . muhammad and i had a lot of fun as he was a huge cricket fan and taught me the ins and outs , but he was apolitical . feisal was an observant muslim of a liberal sect . we traded a lot of details about life in a mosque in comparison to life in a synagogue . he was a bona fide genius i think , and he also opened my eyes to issues vis-à-vis the muslim world and the u.s.a. the syrian was a brilliant man extremely well versed in contemporary history . he had me really working hard and i had to re-examine a lot of previously conceived notions i had . by the way , all without exception were western educated ; not necessarily in western institutions but rather in the western tradition . i like to think i am an intellectually honest person . i invite you to travel the link to my posts to examine my arguments . this has been my experience : i have met here some rabid pro-zionists whose posts i personally find embarrassing . the rabid anti-zionists seem to be an order more vitriolic . i can sense the blind hatred . also , they are easily frustrated with the simplest critical thinking . there really is no debate here at all . it is all quips based on self-enforcing and cross-referenced hate propaganda . to even question its veracity brings immediate indirect fire as opposed to an actual response . based on my own reading and research there is certainly a palestinian narrative of merit . to say otherwise , in my opinion , is nonsensical . i have participated in excellent debate and exchange of information here on these boards . a fair number of times i have been challenged by posters ' comments that required me to stop and re-examine my thinking . always these have been alleged facts that i was not previously aware of and i spent the time researching the issue and verifying the facts . a case on point is my discussion with ed regarding water usage in israel/p-territories . without exception every post that i felt had merit and that i fact-checked did not pan out . some citations were to reputable pro-palestinian sources that i had to delve a lot deeper into the primary source data -LRB- un reports and the like -RRB- . a lot was just unsubstantiated myth mongering devoid of any sources at all . some others were simply foolish . i remember one citation that was to a headline to the effect of `` israel - -LSB- some atrocity -RSB- '' . i tried clicking the headline but there was no link , no links anywhere on the page for that matter . it was just a list of made up headlines . i very strongly notice that all of the pro-palestinian myth mongering is cross-referenced . each `` argument '' refers to other self-documenting resources that refer back in a web of cross-references . then , of course , there is pallywood and fauxtography , the arab/muslim art of invented videos and photographs . finally , there are out-and-out lies that are apparent on their face , ranting really . i did my own research into the apparently endless list of israeli atrocities . i found several clear acts of improper military behaviour , but only a few . i found some of unacceptable civilian behaviour towards palestinians . then there is the government based acts , an example of which is uprooting olive orchards . finally , there are actual war crime type atrocities , for example , the 800-900 arab deaths in this category during the 1948 war as explained by the `` new '' historian benny morris . now , do i mean that palestinians are not killed -- not at all . in my view , the vast majority of so-called atrocities , war crimes , genocide , ethnic cleansing , animal behaviour , etc. ad nauseam , is related to the palestinian insurrection -LRB- intifadah -RRB- in the occupied territories of gaza and the west bank and the israeli attempts to manage and quell the insurrection . these actions fall into a few categories : 1 . clearing a designated military reserve of protestors 2 . quelling insurrection -LRB- rock throwing , etc. -RRB- 3 . immediate retaliation to armed attacks 4 . pro-active attacks by the idf to degrade and destroy palestinian military capabilities 5 . ongoing border screening in other words , i do n't deny the suffering of individual palestinians . i both sympathize and empathize with the pain and suffering . the two peoples are at war . the idf will make every effort to avert collateral damage , but civilians will get hit when a qassam stockpile is hit . palestinians have to wait hours at the border , but every parcel , truck , ambulance , and person must be physically checked for suicide vests and ordinance smuggling . only about 5 % of palestinian attackers get through . that means for every bombing in tel-aviv or jerusalem , 19 others were thwarted or caught at the border . for better or worse , until a final settlement is reached , israel is responsible for the populations in the territories and for order and security . violent insurrection can not be allowed lest anarchy take hold . as part of the occupation , certain areas are classified by military authorities . the justness of it or not is not my point . when a soldier with a rifle under orders to clear the area tells you to do so , one takes his life into his own hands to disobey . when qassam rockets are fired into israel , you can bet your grand-mother 's pearls that a bigger rocket is coming back your way . for that matter , if a palestinian fires rockets next to a civilian home , he knows that the return fire may hit that home as well . he ought to take responsibility for his choice . what are eight year olds doing throwing stones at tanks intermixed with adults armed with assault rifles . all of this is ongoing military operations between two peoples at war . they are not acts of genocide or ethnic cleansing or anything like that . with some exceptions , i find most pro-palestinian posters fall into one single pattern : a two or three sentence post of unsubstantiated outrageous claims . when one calls them out for evidence , i have gotten the run-around as i described above , or just non-answers . i have been engaged in serious debate by pro-palestinian supporters on these boards in only a small minority of instances . i find that this profound penchant for dishonest debate is not so much acts of actual dishonesty , rather it is part and parcel of the overriding arab social characteristic of face-saving , i.e. self-deception . that is , as far as i can tell , so long is face is saved publicly , all is well . prime examples of this are astounding claims of military victory in the face of catastrophic losses and on the verge of military annihilation . by and large i find the scales of dishonest debate tips acutely toward the pro-palestinian side .

POS in fact , the automobile continued rolling after all the shots were fired . see my post above on whether shooting at a driver can be considered a sensible way to stop a driver . actually no . one may search far and wide and find occasional incidents where a 40,000 person strong police force in a city of 8 million with at least 1.5 million visitors every day commits excessive force . the reality is that the nypd has a very good record of not using excessive force . and its record has improved over the years . what is lost in this debate save for my post , is that the nypd will review and severely rebuke the officers as soon as the federal civil rights actions are exhausted - whether the officers go to jail or not . the nypd can not begin its own action until the various prosecutions are complete . the nypd has not supported the officers here . what statements it has made make clear it is leaning to finding the officers acted inappropriately .
NEG perfectly true -- and it was only at the insistence of tony blair that britain entered iraq . tony wanted to be accepted as a member of the ` rat pack ' and followed the u.s. blindly . he had ears only for the white house and would not listen to his mps , party members , or the british electorate . iraq certainly was not a bed for terrorists before the invasion -- but tony and george ploughed that region and look at the deadly harvest iraq and the world is now reaping .
NEG quick question pu - when saddam hussein invaded kuwait and made it obvious that he would go on to saudi . in your opinion should the allies have sat back and left the other m.e. states to sort things out - `` do you just have candle light and fires in your abode ''
NEG not many , but the japanese were n't just killing americancivilians . they killed several million chinese , over a million indonesians , a million or so in french indo-china , several hundred thousand in burma and india . the atomic bombs ended japanese resistance which saved millions of japanese civilians from starvation and pointless deaths in a futile resistance . ------------------------------------------------ but it was america which atom bomb , noone says it was the world or the allies ... america . a-bomb saves lives . period . . if it saved life during second world war , no need to even question how destructive it can be ...
NEU simcha colonsing the moon and making it a fertile place to live might be a good project for the future < < < i believe that zionists can do that with their money . they can even put a new israel there ! it will be the only state out of poor and sick planet earth . don ´ t forget to take uncle sam flag with you !!!!!
NEU right . it was offered by barak . the denial was for a general right of return . what was offered was that palestinians would be absorbed into israel on a case-by-case basis on humanitarian grounds , for example the unification of families . it was n't much of an offer as this already exists in israel . between 1991-2003 over 100,000 palestinians have taken up this offer and moved into israel . what else , then ?
NEG there ya go ruth , each of your rather bigoted points addressed
NEG within days of the democrats controlling the us senate they have called for troop cuts within months hear is the link <a href=" "> apparently the democrats also said during the mid term elections they ; would not cut and run ' well it seems that they are doing the complete opposite no suprises there then
NEG thats bull . and whats more you know its bull . its a symbol of their bigotry and with a very large minority of them it is a symbol of their allience with the terrorists . if its so needed why the hell dont they get out of europe to wear it where its mandatory ?
NEG '' ruth , what do you mean he has n't addressed any of it . '' whoops . typo . that was intended as a question . '' i know because he 's completely missed what i 've said and presented a completely false interpretation .

'' well that 's a pretty good guess . i wo n't address what he 's said specifically because it 's totally missing the point of what i 've been talking about . '' there you go . you 're not constructively replying to what your opponent has to offer . you 're simply refusing to debate it on the grounds that you disagree . in place of actually debating , you spend the whole time demanding that you 're opponent retracts what he 's said . to bolster this demand , you force words into your opponent 's mouth and claim he -LRB- or she - no male inadequacy here -RRB- is ` demonizing ' you , and other such clap trap . '' that 's an unsubstantiated statement on the back of a misrepresentation of what 's being argued . '' that 's his opinion , which he has inferred from what you have written . i have sympathy with his opinion . '' all of this -LRB- of yours -RRB- is avoiding my points still on the table '' sorry ruth , i do n't have a clue what your points are . you 'll have to satisfy predatory lust with anthony .
NEG / / / haesten , what exactly is your problem with gay people ? / / / i do n't think haesten - has a problem with gay people . it 's the other way round gays think people have to kowtow to them !
NEG and it is wholy unjustifiable . it has created grave tensions between ourselves and the honourable arabs . it has costed dear in lives and pain for the wonderful palestinians , that so many european jews were allowed to settle in their land . it has costed us dear in pure economic terms , when the arbs turned the taps in 1973 , following the unanimous western backing of israel in the october war of that year . the resulting recession was the worst the world had seen since the 30 ` ties , bringing the otherwise succesfull boom that have lasted more or less un-interrupted since the end of the second world war to an abrupt end . it made the prices go up 4 times , then salaries rose 4 times , with the inevitable result of a 4 times rise in inflation , when governments tried to cushion the crisis by taking on loans . britain was very close to defaluting on its debts and being put under the administartion of the imf . some of these loans still runs today , albeit in a refinanced form .
NEG '' bet that you do n'teven know what a colt saa m1873 7.5 '' barrel is or come to that a whichester m1894 carbine . i doubt if you could tell a saa m1873 apart from a colt m1911 '' ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... i bet you do n't know the difference between a wooden single rubber band firing pistol , and an exciting triple band ` blaster .

NEG that 's the point . you would assume that without treatment the host organism dies but it turns out that antibiotics are used in humans where the disease being treated is not life threatening but merely inconvenient and where , without treatment , the human would develop immunity to the disease , rather than the disease develop immunity to the treatment . in animals , antibiotics are used to increase yields and thus raise profits in the short term , even though the use of them gives future generations of farmers the problem of seeing their profits reduced to zero or less .
NEG bwahaha !! a former us marine is incapacitated by a domestic cat !! surely he should have lightening reactions and be hard as nails ? - pathetic also if he claimed the injury cost him # 10k in medical bills and # 6k in loss of income , why was he compensated for # 60k ?

'' which diplomacy are we talking about , the palis lack of ... or the israelis lack of ? curious , what the hell is going on in your own country right now with these idiots who have taken to the streets ? i knwo you think of them as brothers and sisters but if i was you i would grab a good strong baseball bat and explain things to them .
NEG manchester me , so you think the jewish groups fighting against colonial rule in british occupied israel were not `` liberation groups '' ? i suppose you would think that the restance against nazi occupation of europe were not resistance groups ? in your book , only islamofacists could be `` freedom fighters '' - like hitlers lot !
NEG richard reed did so when the seucrity was this tight . those of us who travel often , know that at the airports its becomes impossible to carry anything without it being discovered by the x-ray machines . the security at the miami airport must have been pretty lousy , which led the marshals to shoot . because nomatter how people defend this killing , everyone knows that you can not even take a paper clip inside the plane without it being discovered through x-ray machine , and you mean the guy managed to take a bomb ? its a joke .
NEG `` do you have any idea what this fool is saying , cuban pete ? '' the reference to israeli training of kurdish forces is obviously lost on a fox news fan .
NEG it seems that a username of ` talmudist ' is acceptable even though it would be offensive to jews . therefore , since the bbc allows it i am sure they will allow me to call myself ` koranist ' .
NEG smoker surely you are not quite as daft as your message . the americans want to control the oil to stop anyone else controlling it , in particular their enemies . thats why they are in alliance with saudi arabia , and is why their worst nightmare would be if islamist extremists were to take control of saudi arabia . the small states in the gulf are either in alliance with america , or have american bases there , or both . you see america has to make sure it can get oil , and on favourable terms . thats whats meant by controlling the oil . there is also the question of dollars vs euros . thats a question i 'll leave alone for the minute . china is an expanding market for oil and american does want to make sure china doesnt get all the worlds oil , for it would mean the yanks could n't drive around in their big humvees , and that would never do . cheers .
NEG nice try , and i 'll give you credit for that . but none of this addresses the points raised in the original article which prompted this debate , nor does it address any of the subsequent points raised . my history and who i am should be of little interest to you . just address the arguements raised or move on to another thread . but there is no need for you to get personal with me . i 'm not interested in the least who you actually are and i 'd appreciate the same disinterest from you .
NEG / / michael moore is a transparent distorter of evidence / / / i 'm sure he uses the evidence to suit whatever personal expression he wishes to make . thats ' only been going on for about , what , the whole history of the human race ! besides , i would suggest that more flagrant distortions of evidence have been seeping out of the white house and number 10 for the last 8/9 years . indeed , and worse , the absolute manafacture of `` evidence '' has been seeping out . as far as i can see , if we 're getting into a moral bunfight and distortions of evidence , moore 's still winning for me .

NEG `` to the muslim world , '' said barack obama in his inaugural address , `` we seek a new way forward , based on mutual interest and mutual respect . and we apologise profusely for invading iraq and causing the death of 600,000 innocent iraqis , and causing 1 million iraqis to be homeless . '' now that 's more like it . ------------------------------------------------ besides , its not about muslims , its about the american forgien policy ... the policy evilize a group of people , their beliefs and then destroy them ... the native americans , african slaves , england when it was the empire over north america , and on and on an on , ... if today muslims accept this apology look like thingie , the americans will find a new enemy and do the same thing to them . . i think muslims have an opportunity to end this american value , tradition and forgein policy . .
NEU '' ... however the fact that the `` us had eliminated regimes in iraq and afghanistan but failed to replace them with stable political structures '' is of course blanking out the fact that there are fledgling governments in both those countries that will , eventually , overcome their difficulties . '' if a think tank report slipped over into this kind of wishful thinking then it really should get a caning .
NEG i might be a little naive , but why can america have nuclear weapons pointing at iran , and then tell iran they cant have them ?
NEG that 's a stupid analogy . the arab middle east is millions of square miles , israel is a tiny part of it . a better analogy might be to say that suppose asians fleeing persecution in , say , africa had come to the uk , which they regarded as a homeland , to form a peaceful and prosperous minority , but the english had decided to murder and expel them , so the un had to step in and partition leicester for them to live in . at which time , armies from germany and france invaded to try and destroy leicester . they tell the remaining english inhabitants of leicester to leave because it is going to be destroyed , but the asians manage to fight them off . it would have been much better for everyone if the ugandan asians had been allowed to settle peacefully ... oh wait , they did . and now they generate 2.5 times as much gdp as the average person .
NEU fec people have been believing in a god since the dawn of mankind . this does n't make ` god ' a fact or visa versa but it does kinda make the believers a reality . the trick is for all concerned , be they believers in their god , aetheists or agnostics -LRB- such as i -RRB- , to use their intellectual energy in harnessing the good in all these facets , not in tring to impose their very personal views/beliefs on others , either through so called intellectual arguement or by force . j
NEU stevie , can you type completely in non-sequiteurs ??
NEG curious ... read the article in the new yorker -LRB- a magazine , btw , not a newspaper -RRB- ... if i had handed in a paper with so many he saids/she saids and ` sources close to the subject ' without any further evidence , my professors would have thrown my paper back in my face ... what happened to sy between college and now is anybodys guess ... he has arrived to his own conclusion -LRB- with few stops for actual facts along the way -RRB- based on his own prejudice , and then builds his story around that ...

POS there are about 5 million jews living in australia coastal area . the most expensive part of australia . lucky people , indeed .
NEG james why do you see every critique of your critique as a personal attack ? again , what branch of law do you practice ? i asked before and you never answered . that is how debate works , not you put up your side and we just accept it with out asking for clarification or offering counter opinion . you claim a neo-con economy benefits the rich but offer nothing but weak cliche generalizations and then when this is pointed out you say `` this is the response i get '' . for starters , in case you werent aware , a persons income tax is based upon their annual earnings in salary and holdings such as stocks , money market accounts , properties etc. even a massive tax break -LRB- for which there is a cap no matter who is in the white house as noted earlier -RRB- is not going to be a dent in the loses a very wealthy person would face in a weak economy . many wealthy people are doctors , business owners , heads of large business whose salary and bonuses are dictated by the companies profits . there are more people in the us that fall into the categories of middle-income , lower-middle income . these are the people that spend the most . so tell me how a rich doctor is going to benefit from their being fewer people with quality health insurance or the ability to pay their medical fees ? tell me how a rich business owner is going to benefit from the regular joe having less money to spend at his place of business ? tell me how a wealthy guy who runs a factory or retail store is going to benefit from lower production , less staff and lower profitibility ? quit putting out accusations and then claim `` personal attack '' when people try and point to flaws in the flaws you point out .
NEG ... what a surprise ! the sri lankans say that after the tsunami , a disaster far far worse than the force 3 hurricane which blew away parts of the american south , they had set up feeding centres within 2 days , there was no looting , no raping , no guns on the streets , no people performing in front of any tv camera they could find ... in other words they behaved in a civilised manner . they contrast that with the way the americans have behaved and ask how they can profess to be a civilised society . a question i have asked many times , but never had a satisfactory answer .
NEG surely the richest country on the planet can do better than this ? <a href=" "> news.bbc.co.uk / 1/hi / ... </a>
NEG i find the psychology of the pro-gun nut interesting . so in your face and aggressive , alternating with a wheedling victimhood and a sneering snideness . in short precisely the sort of mental instability you would want to keep as far away from guns as possible . of course not every american gun owner is as bad as that , but there does seem to be a correlation with how much they care about having killing tools in the closet and how barking they are .
NEG of course it is . zimbabwe just proves how sickeningly opportunist and false all the rhetoric from the iraq hawks about ` humanitarian intervention ' was . the neocons in america and labour hawks here see nothing to gain by invading zimbabwe , whereas there was much to gain by invading iraq . saddam 's human rights record was a smokescreen to hide the real motives of the iraq invasion .
NEG dipanna east timor is a part of indonesia that was colonized by the portuguese and made it speak their language and have their cristian religion . but as muslims are always the losers , thanks to american and its baby israel , the indonesian people lost that part of their land .

NEU `` there are some idjits in the us who are willing to do the same ... '' and in canada also , stevie . our government was at ne time hooked on the multicult fad and were throwing around money with an abandon that a drunken socialist sailor would envy . all that 's mostly gone now -LRB- with the predictable cries of racism when the funds started to dry up -RRB- and i 'm pleased about that , despite my own little cultural group being the recipient of some of their largesse . i 'm suspecting that although it 's too late for europe to do anything about their problems , quiet steps are being taken here to discourage immigration from a religious group prominent in the recent news . while we ca n't tar everyone with the same brush -LRB- we are still liberal people after all ! -RRB- i think it likely that messages written in code are being sent out to the customs people that should there be a close call between equally qualified applicants for residency , the successful applicant will not be a member of one of the world 's major religious groups . why take chances that one of them is n't intent on comitting terrorist acts when we know there are other people who just want to live in peace and make better lives for themselves and their families ?
NEU you mean like eating and working and sleeping ?
NEG i do not see this ` lone voice ' as daring to do anything . it 's very difficult to quantify the ` savagery ' in any meaningful sense . it 's true that in any community there are people who behave collectively and compassionately whilst there are those that do not . this is no great revelation in itself . a society that fosters ` individualism ' , that favoured by the journalist , is less likely to produce acts of solidarity . a society neglected in run down housing schemes whilst being bombarded with images of wealth is likely to produce a degree of anti-social behaviour . a society that , when a major storm hits , is met with loaded guns to prevent ` looting ' , one that is criminalised for being poor , is likely to show inappropriate rage and anger . the extent of this , we really do n't know . these are basic points . but they are far from the mind of this journalist . the point of the article is to make right wing points on the back of suffering .

NEU and what about holland , france , germany , sweden and great britain . let their jews , muslims and christians live under one flag , one democracy and swear allegiance to their flags and national brethren . then we would be highlighting that 50-70 % of prisoners in france are muslims . we would n't need to make those distinctions because they would all be french citizens . what would it matter what religion they come from when everyone is a french patriot in a unified single mono-culture society .
NEG mon , 24 mar 2008 20:31 gmt , in reply to theforeverman4 in message 9 i do believe you 've made a mistake . in your message 7 you said : but ... ... but do you know where the knesset , the israeli parliament , sits ? in tel aviv ? wrong the knesset is in jerusalem . jerusalem and not tel aviv is the capitol of israel .
NEG `` is that a valid reason to abandon the iraqis to the tender mercies of al qaeda ? if the allied troops pulled out , i fear iraq would fall to islamofascism in a very short time . '' the foreign salafists are there entirely for the opportunity to have a pop at the americans . there 's no doubt that if the new shia rulers and baathists do n't make some agreements , there will be continued civil conflict . however , although the american troops are keeping a lid on this violence , they can neither solve it nor stop it .

NEG my best guess is that the martians will be taking-over teh uk before ` jews ' could be bothered . what if jews had bought trafalgar square and erected a 100 foot golden calf ? or maybe bought glasgow and turned it into a theme park ?
NEG shalom well i think that it is a fact that the book depository was behind and to teh right of the motorcade and that jfks head moved `` up and to the left '' there is not hollywoodisation of this simple fact , the simple logical explanation being that he was shot from front and to -LRB- his -RRB- right ... i.e th grass knoll , where by coincidence 54 people witnessed hearing a close gunshot and seeing gun smoke , one of those being a police man ... this is all documented evidence ... so applying occamøs razor here could only yield one possibility . also if your saying it is not logical that they could have put a couple of guy sinto the stratosphere for a couple of days , played a video on tv and then brought them back i donøt see how you can follow that it is logical that they put a man on the moon in 1969 when computers were the size of a sportsfield the transistor radio was only just born and yet they havenøt done it since ! hey i 'll believe logic when i see some ...
NEG comprehension ??? i actually said that what they do in their own time , out of school is their business . if they want to indulge in anti-semitism then that is their business . if its against the law then its the law 's business ! you definitely missed that !
NEU or this . even as a muslim you must agree with this . it is the killers and their supporters who need to learn understanding and tolerance , not their victims .
NEU a unified position by the quartet is absolutely required to force peace . we 're tired of the circle of violence . there must not be individual counry wavering like chirac did with iran -LRB- chirac : `` it 's ok if iran has nukes . hey do n't quote me on that ! '' -RRB- .
NEG -LSB- quote -RSB- so , one has to ask , why did they go ahead and decide to put her forward for this award ? it has been suggested that she received the award as some kind of morale boosting exercise . well , i think it 's rather insulting to previous holders of this bravery award to suggest that the bar has been lowered to accommodate this notion . -LSB- / quote -RSB- somebody already mentioned pr ! beharry and his vc was another recipient whom people , in the services , questioned the reason why . i guess all i 'm saying is that in her case , many more servicemen have shown much more courage with much less recognition . insulting to previous holders ? yes perhaps , but the mod today is much more aware of the media image that it projects , besides the mod love to get a female on the front cover ! :d
NEG `` this is a general post script to hothousemat , puydedome , astute ann & all selective humanists on this board . selective humanists are those people who will preach fire & brimstone against any wrongdoing '' `` the selective humanists , demand that the jews should have different rules . i rest my case . '' well , well , well . for someone who does n't like racism and uneven-handed behaviour , ben sure knows how to pigeonhole ! i 've explained myself previously in this thread . from what i wrote there , it is obvious that ben 's latest post does n't apply to me and , therefore , i can only assume that ben has either skimped in respect of reading it , or has a cognitive malfunction . in either case , his posts are so one-sided that they deserve nothing but contempt . calling people `` racist '' when they 're not is unacceptable behaviour in my book . so i 'll treat his posts with the contempt that they deserve .

NEU it is rather amusing that judaism has evolved to the extent there are liberal and progressive jews who will break the laws of the torah . and we contrast that with islam where some muslims do seem to be stuck in the days of the beginnings of islam and some wish to take us all back there . contrast that judaism does n't want to take anyone anywhere .
NEG its in the media and in conflict with everyone including itself .
NEG sorry tony - its true ! < < the 14 year old al dura was dead > > and indeed he was , but that video at the time was a best-seller in arab homes showing the boy ` alive and well ' meaning that no palestinian martyr dies but they go on living in paradise which we all know palestinians truly believe . sadly enough it is not propaganda .

NEG i would agree with this but only up to a point and the article is n't clear about this : is it really , as you say , `` muslim-only time '' ? if so , i agree . if , as the article may be implying , these times are accessible to women of any faith that wish to swim in these particular conditions , then i disagree with you that it 's `` segregation by ethnicity '' . does anyone actually know ? by the way , this just reminds me of a sad personal story : years ago my mother was on an ulpan program rooming with a young palestinian woman and they became close friends . at that time my mother was a big swimmer and availed herself of the swimming pool on a daily basis for exercise and heat relief . after a number of months , her friend asked if she could go with my mom early one morning and have my mom teach her how to swim . they did this once and it resulted in verbal hostility from some arab men who happened to witness it . she wore a very conservative -LRB- by western standards , of course -RRB- one piece swimsuit and was careful to remain fully covered up until the last possible moment when entering and exiting the pool . a day later , the woman came to my mom in tears because the word had gotten back to her family in the west bank and they had phoned her threatening to remove her from the program if she did that again . she went again -- this time even earlier to avoid being seen and even more careful with regard to modesty . her family made good on their threat and she was gone in a matter of days and my mom was never able to contact her and to this day does n't know whether she received any of her letters or not or what became of her . i do n't care what people wan na do with regard to modesty and dress , in theory : but i do object to legal adults being denied the right to make their own decision on what they want to wear in places where it 's acceptable for others to dress the same -- ie , if it 's at a pool where swimsuits are accepted attire at that time .

NEG '' '' the point is that it was n't just jewish immigration that occured but massive arab immigration aswell '' '' and where exactly did i deny the fact that there was arab immigration ? i know there was both arab and jewish immigration , but the jewish immigration far outnumbered the number of arabs who were coming into the region , because unlike the jews there was a good number of arab 's who fled the region as well . '' '' this myth about ` palestinians ' having lived in the land for 1000s of years is simply that , a myth '' '' obviously you 're completely ignoring everything i have said thus far . the point here is there have always been muslim 's in that region for the past 1000 years that have outnumbered the jews . therefore , the current palestinian 's have had far more ancestors living over the past millenia then the number of israeli ancestors , since most of them are all immigrants and therefore have no traceable family history in the region before the 20th century . '' '' is there a library near you ? go and read ` from time immemorial ' by joan peters '' '' lol , this alone explains why you have such a one sided and narrow minded view on this . the fact that you rely on a book which is engineered towards promoting a tired old excuse which has been debated to death does you no favours whatsoever .

POS `` there is little room for `` becoming '' homosexual after birth . people are indeed born that way , but it is not known what the reason is why they are what they are . ok ? '' hi conny , zabak , others lets not pretend that rahman 's paper settles the issue . i think the current understanding is that sexual orientation does not fall neatly into discrete categories , but rather places a person on a continuum ranging from enitrely attracted to the same sex or entirely attracted to the opposite sex . whatever genetic influence there is on sexual orientation then , it is not ` either or ' . beyond that cultural factors do seem to push peoples orientation this way or that . its worth noting that absolute sexual categories did not/do not exist in some cultures . -LRB- ancient greece -RRB- it is a little smililar to whether people are left/right handed oddly enough . it is estimated that hereditary factors account for just 32 percent of variability in handedness , but that doesnt account for 90 % of people being right handed . a cultural bias towards right handedness accounts for that more effectively . people can and do change their sexual orientation in the course of their lives . ` gay ' people go ` straight ' , ` straight ' people go ` gay ' . the importance of cultural factors in determining sexual orientation should be acknowleged . self actualisation is an important factor in personal happiness -LRB- and therefore , social cohesion -RRB- . people must not be brought up to think that they are -LRB- or must be -RRB- exactly one way or another . here is a decent paper on it : <a href=" "> cat.inist.fr / ? amodel ... </a> note that my concern is that people should be able to freely discover their position on a continuum rather than to `` cure '' a natural/social orientation . the field of study is frought with political issues obviously , that should not clould investigation . as scientists we want to just know what is going on , not determine what should go on .

NEG i think as political statements they are as valid as the danish cartoons . if the danish cartoons are a matter of freespeech then so are these . there is of course an important point to be made , that is the holocaust should be open to debate , it should be open to scrutiny since truth and an accurate account can be more valuable than an account that is denied access and may lead to prison . if the koran should be open to critical analysis as most zionists insist , then why not the holocaust ?
POS nothing happened to it except that the lebanese have decided not to exercise that right . this is , as i said before , because they would happily see the end of hezbollah and can then hopefully rekindle the fire of economic growth and success and business acumen taht is inherrent in the character of every lebanese person i have ever met .
NEG `` each groups has its fanatics , do n't tar all muslims with the same brush !

NEG i think you 're being hypocritical , john . you attempt to dismiss any and all disagreement with your representation by pre-empting a few potential counterpoints and denoting them `` go -LSB- ing -RSB- round in escalating circles '' , thereby showing no willingness whatsoever to hear differing viewpoints as you prematurely belittle them with your `` again if you wish '' . but that 's precisely what you 're doing ... going round in circles ! or at least that 's how it appears to me in the absense of any apparent desire to go anywhere else ... israel have said that they were within their rights under the ceasefire to engage in this action -LRB- and , according to the first link -LSB- iht -RSB- that comes up from your google link , made this clear before the action -RRB- : okay , this is something you think was a mistake and perhaps you and certainly others might disagree and believe it 's more than just a bad pr decision but an actual violation ... but the main point you 're missing is that the ceasefire violation by hezbollah that israel is claiming it was responding to has not been used by israel as an excuse to abandon the ceasefire further than this action -LRB- or , presumably and reportedly , any others like it -RRB- , from your beeb link : ~ ~ `` israel ... insisted the truce held . '' ~ ~ so where are you going ? let 's even say we agree that it was a pr mistake ... what happens next ? is it an excuse for hezbollah to announce a complete disconnection from the ceasefire ? is it an excuse for the lebanese government to renege ? surely that gets it all back to where you suggest you do n't want it -- going round in circles -- right ? or is there something you have n't yet offered that would explain this apparent contradiction ? the bbc article you link to inadvertently touches on this further in parallel to this point and i think it 's key to the conflict and , unfortunately , in much of the discussion going on it 's being avoided : ~ ~ `` the bbc 's nick childs in beirut correspondent says the un 's main concern is that the incident both highlights the urgent need for un reinforcements and will put off potential troop contributors , because it projects an image of insecurity . '' ~ ~ an `` image of insecurity '' ? it did n't have that before ? so `` the un 's main concern '' is that any troops it might send will be aware of what 's going on ? is that a sneaked snippet of the planned ` rules of engagement ' ... know as little as possible about the conflict and make sure any and all troops are given a false sense of security just to ensure that they will , once again , be nothing more than sitting ducks in the line of fire ? and these parallels emanate from the same underlying point illustrated above and again as we see from the lebanese defense minister -LRB- also from the beeb article -RRB- : ~ ~ `` he said any rocket fired from lebanese territory would be considered collaboration with israel to provide a pretext for it to strike . ... ... -LSB- he -RSB- said that if the un failed to give `` clear answers '' in response to the raid he `` might be forced to ask the cabinet early next week to halt the army deployment in the south '' . '' ~ ~ so there we are : that 's the only result i can see of a discussion criticizing israel for this ` pr disaster ' ... excuse for hezbollah , excuse for siniora and excuse for the un . of course it warrants addressing but it 's your purpose that will define how it 's addressed and your address which will expose your purpose and , at the moment , it appears to be a desire to go round in circles and add your weight to the ` pr disaster ' .

NEG the difference between the turkish situation and the nazi holocaust is that the ideology and administration in germany was removed by ww2 and prosecuted providing eventually for a measure of closure for germany and a separation of the modern federal republic from that era . however in turkey , the young turk revolution was central to the nationalist rather than religious nature of the armenian genocide and even after the governments takeover by ataturk massacres continued . the genocide is intertwined with the birth of the modern turkish state and not something that can be `` blamed '' on the old ottoman authorities . therefore recognition of the genocide imperils modern turkey in a way which neither germany or even japan have had to deal with . add to this the treatment of the kurds by the turkish goverment all makes this a modern issue and not a historical one .

'' if as you say that is the case in america and/or canada it is not so simple in england . if a property does n't realise the sum secured against it then the borrower is still liable to pay the difference and the absence of debtor 's prisons does not negate that nor is it any guarantee that those who do n't fulfill their obligations wo n't see the inside of a prison . current leniency toward personal bankruptcy may see some changes but that was not the case in the eighties and to my knowledge it was a busy time for bailiffs in many areas . `` there is a correction going on in the housing market and it will be international . it began over a year ago and people should have been paying attention .

NEG `` it is a regular tactic of yours to turn an expression of opinion into a question that gives a completely different version of that expression '' . that 's because i believe these statements are not thought through and contains fuzzy logic . you seldom are able to respond to these questions but instead complain that they are asked . on the other hand you offer statements i never made and pigeonhole me in positions that are n't mine . while you may believe this to be honest , i do n't . i 'll withdraw the remark with the understanding that you 'll quote me directly in the future rather than trying to make a counterargument against me from memory .
NEG oh yes , the plaintive cry of the desperate european , `` it 's all america 's fault '' . and as you sink deeper into your morass of wide unemployment , corruption trials , rioting muslims , further riots of hopelessly unrealistic students , and rapidly decreasing influence in the world , i 'm sure you 'll find a way to blame all of this on america too . bon chance !
NEG problem is , especially with china , is there is n't anyway to prvent it , if they do n't want to stop . kick them out of the wto ? wo n't do a thing . no one is going to prohibit trade with them , because unfortunately we need them just as much as they are hurting some of our industries with that practice .
NEG that was 39 years ago . do you have any examples of protest/criticism of the goverment being `` ruthlessly crushed '' that are a little more current ?
NEG the acts of hizbollah out of lebanon , are a direct provocation on israel , a declaration of war . israel 's reactions are heavy handed , short-sighted and unbalanced . it had a clear right to react , but its chosen manner is brutish and reckless . israel is one of the nations that exceeds in digging its own hole . these are the facts .
NEU when will the palestinians be ready to be trusted with running themselves ? ------------------------------------------------ when they will be given total freedom , all at once ... not in installments . . not like the dysfunctional parents of a 16 yr ofd who dont give him the keys to the house and lock the door at 9 pm when all his friends are still out , just because he has `` shown `` no reponsiblity because he comes back to his house through the window . give him the keys and then question his responsiblity ...
NEG to aiejrlsk - from you ... ` israel 's medievil barbarism towards palestinians ' ... ! just who are the medievil groups here who resort to primitive and barbaric methods to kill israelis but those ` palestinian sucide-bombers ' and those little children who become ` human bombs ' just to murder jews who they believe took their land and houses ... israel is today one of the most progressive and modern little states you could find and it is punishment for the arabs - who call themselves ` palestinians ' ... ! that they can not keep up with the development and advance in science , technology and medicine which israel prides itself on achieving .
NEU in what way was i agreeing ? i said that not all zionists are israelis . you made a leap of faith there . <blockquote class="quotefirst"> <blockquote> hi dez . i dont understand your post . please clarify . <blockquote> <div class="extraquotes2"> calling it a zionist conspiracy does n't neccessarily mean israel . not all zionists are israeli

NEG it is - but i have seen it used on this board many times by islamists when some of our black participants dont agree with them . its appalling . if you dont support terrorism , or -LRB- majoritively -RRB- dare to critique islam , then you are an uncle tom - same goes for the use of ` zionist ' for anyone else . i think that must be a common theme running through some of these mosques .
NEG does n't executed mean put to death ?
NEG wendymann : `` go to project for new american century and all will be revealed '' what some americans planned to extend their empire , though laughable , are not what i 'm after . i just want to know what goes on in the head in of someone that feels obliged to go out and kill innocent civilians . this was well planned so certainly they think it will further their objectives - how ?
NEG insightful one , you are simply being dishonest . they were told that they were to be executed immediately and blind folded and made to stand against a wall in front of firing squad and terrorised in other ways . that is what we are told by the sailors and why do you disbelieve them ? this is not the uk government talking but private individuals . i note you seem to have only a tenuous grasp on truth but perhaps others including these citizens have slightly higher standards than you
NEU windy and mcguiness do that too , its nothibg new .
NEG hi colonelartist , colonelartist quote : `` trust me i knew my neighbors well , and they knew me well , but invasion makes people change for the worst ... if allowed to invade i can simply destroy both your or your neighbors work place , and homes ... '' colonelartist quote : `` it just takes three days to lay the foundations of anarchy ... . if you have n't learnt from the first three days after invasion of iraq , then you have n't learnt anything ... '' instead of talking about theoretical situations such as the usa being occupied in the 21st century why not talk about real life examples ? what we have learned in dozens and dozens of invasions and occupations the normal thing is to resist the invaders rather than spend the time killing your neighbors and ordinary civilians blowing up other ordinary civilians is not normal behavior . for example many countries in asia were occupied by the japanese imperial army from china to korea to the philippines to thailand etc and the civilians under occupation never started blowing each other up in markets or temples etc. when the us army occupied japan and other asian countries the japanese & other civilians never started to kill each other . nazi germany occupied most of europe and the europeans never started to kill each other . then the russians occupied eastern europe and the allies western europe after the war and the civilians did n't start to kill each other after three days , three years etc. india was occupied by the british for years and years and the indians did n't suddenly turn on their neighbors and start killing them . bulgaria , romania , greece , macedonia etc were occupied by the ottomans and the civilians did n't turn on each other . the muslims occupied spain for seven centuries and the spanish did n't start killing each other after a 3 days or 3 weeks or 3 months or 3 years etc. tibet has been occulted by the chinese since the 1950s and the tibetan civilians did n't start to kill each other . however today we have attack after attack from ordinary muslims on other ordinary muslims in the market , schools , hospitals , and mosques day after day in iraq so explain how this muslim on muslim violence is a western conspiracy ? so tell us all colonelartist just how this american/jewish conspiracy works that forces or tricks the good muslims of iraq into killing each other ? just give up the background outline on how this conspiracy works . so far you have just told us there is a western conspiracy that is causing this so no outline to us so we can see what you are referring to . by the way i would appreciate an answer from anyone what is this western conspiracy fro dag_petersen who refers to it all the time , or do n't trust anyone etc. anyone who can explain this american/jew/west conspiracy please step forward and do so because i am really curious to hear it outlined . warmest regards , smoker
NEG the iraqi people voted for democracy . the coalition want to help them get democracy . the islamic lunatics will do everything they can to stop the west succeeding because it will show up iran -LRB- and al queda and all the criminals in the middle east -RRB- and what they really stand for : anarchists .
NEG some clapped out conspiracy site quoting a mish mash of sources does not provide any evidence of anything . and as for your own remarks . . `` some jews do not allow any other view than that very carefully manicured myth '' just how are people ` not allowing any other views ' historical research is available to all and historical resarch proves millions died . and not just jews , there is no myth there . you are a good example of how hatred and bigotry lead to blindness .
NEG this is to up the pressure on iran they have it coming
NEG we are n't going to agree helen . the anti-semitism in that case is incidental , finegold 's offence in kl 's eyes -LRB- and mine too -RRB- is his choice of employer . and the fuss made over any anti-semitism is politically inspired . just as the `` anti-semitism '' detected when pro-israelis start losing an argument is politically inspired . when anti-semitism is used by a bit of low life like finegold to gain the moral high ground the i refuse to accept it is a valid charge .
NEG no , just observant people . just as you are giving your observation . and zi would never confuse you with a policeman/woman in a million years .
NEU interesting . are you compelled to respond to threads on this messageboard , handy ? i fear i waste a lot of time here but i do n't think one thread is more the cause than another .
NEG `` simcha3 why does everybody say that israel is obligated to return to the pre 1967 lines when resolution 242 says israel should return territories not all territory and this was inentilaly worded this way because the un never expected israel to return to the pre war borders and also the conditions for israel returning anything is in return for peace and the arabs recognising israel . '' its a pity that you are so desperate to justify the annexing of the occupied lands . it has to do with wider international law , i suggest that you look at 242 in context with those obligations . if we are to so reliant on intent , then the intent was of course for israel and palestine to occupy the same amount of land . so why does israel not feel obligated to meet this requirement . in fact why does israel deny a whole people the right to self determination and statehood . it doesnt make sense for a people that regularly defines itself as being victims .
POS hi stuart , as a refinement to your proposal , would it be acceptable for : -LRB- a -RRB- me to ask one or two of ruth 's questions , and ; -LRB- b -RRB- ruth to take up your answer/s ? alternatively -LSB- variation on sub-clause -LRB- b -RRB- -RSB- for me to take up your answer/s having consulted with ruth beforehand ? let 's really get to the bottom of this one ! yours , gavin
NEG unfortunately eyes wide open is actually eyes firmly shut ! if i do n't `` know '' that russia has carried out these extra judicial killings , it 's because no independent human rights organisation or journalist is allowed anywhere near the crime scenes !! and the killing you speak of in iraq is perpetrated by the terrorists . you know ; the terrorists that blow up innocent civilians with car bombs every other day ! i note that you are very fussy with evidence in this case , but so-far unproven allegations against the cia are taken as fact when it suits your argument . so far the allegations of torture against the cia are pure conjecture . rules of engagement you describe are correct - however how does one determine that a terrorist -LRB- who is fanatical and may well have no regard for their own life , let alone an american soldier 's -RRB- is no longer a threat ? welcome to the cold , harsh reality of urban warfare . if any american soldier has taken it upon themselves to deliberately kill or harm innocent civilians , then those soldiers in question should be brought to justice , and no doubt will be if any solid evidence is available .
NEG have not the greeks a poor record on how they treat their mentally handicapped etc ?
NEG mr silver - princess diana was killed in a car accident - she would be alive today is she was wearing a seat belt . there is so much evidence that hitler killed himself in his bunker that i am amazed you even raise the question . arafat was sick , ill and died - simple as that and oswald killed kennedy . some might take all the conspiracy theories seriously until you finally realise how people can turn a straight forward thing like two planes flying into a building and turn it on its head into the most unbelievable bizarre theories imaginable . if they can do that with the wtc attacks then we should not be suprised that the kennedy assasination attracts such comment .
POS `` got any quotes available for this claim , rjsc rjsc , '' yup `` it 's as though we 're living in a parallel universe .

NEG / / ok let me rephrase it.in britain arabs and muslims are generally accepted as friends.if they are routinely spoken of as enemies in america then the americans doing this are being racist . / / `` a novel idea . '' not to use in the uk , but then we 're not in a state of permanent paranoia like americans seem to be .
NEG but ` bliar ' rhymes with ` liar ' , more apropriate i 'm sure you agree .
NEG `` you really think that arabs were stupid enough to encourage hitler to kill jews in europe '' some arabs ... abolutely . to deny is just plain stupid .
NEG . . `` i saw what our artillery rounds did to people . i saw whole iraqi towns engulfed in flames . there were iraqi people dead by the roadside , and i could n't tell if they were men or women '' . a growing number of american servicemen are now speaking out about the brutality and futility of george w cretins lousy and unneccessary invasion of iraq , and mothers of the dead troops are demanding that cheney and bush are brought to account for the lies and the deaths of their children
NEU no . ` murder ' is a legal term referring to one type of ` unlawful killing ' . killing animals for meat is perfectly legal , therefore it is not murder .

NEU > albert - as i 've told you before , the first korean war was a response to north korean , and then later chinese aggression , against south korea , by a united nations force . not just the us acting unilaterally . < why not let the north koreans and their chinese ally take the whole of korea in 1953 , after all they are all koreans , and it would have saved millions of lives , and today they would either be rapidly building themselves up after the collapse of communism like eastern europe , or more likely since soviet communism has never got anything to do with it , they would like china have adapted capitalist measures in recognition of this system un-rivalled properties for development of nations and satisfying of their peoples , while rsataining -LRB- for some more years -RRB- a formal communist leadership .

POS hi speed ! sorry for not coming back to your comments earlier , my day got busy ... `` i have mixed feelings about it vina . '' yes . so do i , which is why i posted the question . there are so many possibilities and different scenarios , that i think we can only point at the most general and usual cases . so i think that that is why the harrison ford case is not applicable to most people . certainly this is millionaire celebrity and given his financial status , as you said , he will not be confronted with the typical cases of not being able to pay babysitting for the not so pleasant tasks j , more time available for parenting , etc. '' perhaps in some ways even a better parent as they would have years more wisdom and life experience to pass along , be more mature themselves than say a very young parent might be . '' yes that may be a positive thing , but also the bigger the generational gap the most difficult it may be to understand each other . '' so , i think that a given persons financial stability , emmotional readiness , maturity level and frame of time to actually spend with the child - particularly during the early developemental years , plays more of a significant role in what sort of parent they will make than does their age . '' lets face it , its just like that harry chapin song `` cats in the cradle '' '' i love that song ... . `` by the time most kids are in their late teens and beyond , they dont spend all that much time with their parents anyway. : '' true . this is however more than not the rule of life , but by the time children pass the teenage stage , get into adulthood and most of all , as they become parents themselves , then they will start `` respecting '' their parents again and begin to understand in retrospect why their parents acted the way they did ... so parents now become the best friends , allies and advisers . this is the part that i see as downside when having children late in life ... now in the case of this woman in the article , she had twins . speed , i can tell you how i was super-handful with one ! so even as a young person , i was exhausted all the time ! and the second baby came less than 2 years after -LRB- i know the same was for you -RRB- ... so how this woman , who naturally wont have all the energy of a person in her 20s or 30s , will be able to cope with newborn twins !!!? or she may turn out to do better than all of us !

NEG oh please . every other os in the world handles this better than vista . this is microsoft catering to the shit for brains users out there who click on every flashing banner on the net and then blame microsoft for providing an insecure system . why should i be inconvenienced because of them ? there are plenty of people who know how to use their system properly and even run their machine without anti-virus/spyware software without any problems . you know why ? because they 're not fucking retarded . <br> <br> i bet your one of those people who drink a bottle of draino unless the warning label said not to . i do n't want my os holding my hand for me .
NEG i would have to say i 'm torn on the issue . on one hand , i like the idea of having work to do here in the us . i like money , i like having a job . and when people buy from my company -LRB- an american one -RRB- , i get to keep my job . i know there 's all sorts of talk from people about how ` oh protectionism does n't work ! ' reality is : if my company does n't make money , they lay off tons of people . which they have done and continue to do . <br> <br> there should be incentive to keeping jobs in the us , and it should n't come at just a monetary price tag . unfortunately , it 's all about the money . and if there 's no money to be made here , then there 's no reason to have companies here . <br> <br> we have nothing to export . we do n't have tons of cheap labor . we ca n't survive on $ 2/day like they can in some of these nations . we 've built regulations into our system to protect our workers and our consumers . we ca n't just go throwing lead paint into toys and poisons into toothpaste to reduce the cost of production . <br> <br> unfortunately , as a result of this and the result of the ability to communicate and travel to far off nations there 's no incentive at all to have jobs here when you can make significantly more money doing it elsewhere . <br> <br> so yes , i believe we need some way to enforce some minor protectionism in our economy . i 'm not saying cut off completely import and export or anything of that nature . but i 'm saying there needs to be incentive to stay focused on our country . there 's nothing wrong with this . most other countries have a protectionist policy when it comes to their workforce and it works out very well for them .
POS christian bale kicks fucking ass !
NEG yeah , i 'm sure she gave it to one of her friends - i have some doubt that four high school senior girls from an upscale community all had their own cellphones . / sarcasm <br> <br> i 'm from rochester too . i always said -LRB- before texting came to be as big as it is -RRB- that it 's not talking on the phone while driving that 's a problem , it 's dialing . <br> <br>

NEG spray-painted lead .
POS some people play to be competitive or to be creative . sure , those things are fun in themselves but only to certain people . what detour is getting at here is that they just play the game without worries simply to have fun , not to be the best -LRB- or even any good , for that matter -RRB- .

NEG for most people , its a search engine , nothing more . for those stupid enough to have bought into the whole web 2.0 cloud bollocks then yes , they 're going to be in the shit . or not . those who will really be in the shit are the google doccers daft enough not to have local copies and corporates stupid enough to be running their email system on gmail . <br> <br> the rest of us will just go ` meh ' and use something else . <br> <br> i do n't use gmail , i do n't use google apps . if google disappeared completely , i 'd just click on the down arrow next to the google icon in the search box of firefox and choose another from the list , that 's how completely and utterly irrelevent google is in my life . if it 's there i 'll use it , if it is n't , i 'll use something else . recently though , i have been using something else - ixquick - and it seems to be better than google .

NEG all of you idiot nutcases posting anti-marijuana propaganda from government websites , you need to watch a bbc documentary called should i smoke dope ? it was done by a journalist who compared pot to alcohol . she smoked different types , and performed all sorts of experiments while intoxicated . guess what ? everything that our government is telling us about pot is a lie , her conclusion was that pot is less harmful than alcohol .

POS no , games are n't responsible - we are responsible . it 's our choice ...
NEG incorrect ^ <br> <br> 1 -RRB- the evidence that suggests peds make a pitcher throw harder is substantially weak . the sentence you 're responding to -LRB- ` chemically enhanced pitches ' -RRB- was a figure of speech -- peds help pitchers reduce fatigue as the season wears on , thus making them more effective in the later months than they otherwise would be . example : ryan franklin 2003 . he had a career year where he was able to throw 200 + innings of quality pitching despite * zero * enhancement to his ` stuff , ' was busted in 2004 , and has since found starting significantly more difficult and has been relegated to a relief role . <br> <br> 2 -RRB- velocity induces * vastly * more swinging strikes than it does turning ordinary flyballs into home runs . if anything , a fastball with more zip on it because of peds would hurt barry more often that it would help him , as it would all hitters . <br> <br> ^ this sentence may be factually correct but the insinuation behind it is wrong .
NEG i us them and thy deliverd
NEG vitriolandangst , you said : ` cuba , is under a damn embargo from the us for the past 40 years . it has nothing to do with trade restrictions . ' <br> <br> an embargo is a set of trade restrictions . judging from your other incoherent comments in this thread , however , i 'll forgive your mistake as simply a product of your elementary nature . <br> <br> intrepidia is exactly right . relying only on domestic production is terrible for an economy . you can also check out north korea .

POS it looks like the sheep is laughing about it in the picture .
NEG the fact that it promotes islam is n't what 's shocking , it 's the fact that it 's ` hidden ' and not obviously a religious product . if it did say ` christianity is the light ' it would either be obvious on the front that it was religious , or it would probably be just as controversial . <br> <br> * edit * i did a bit of research , apparently there 's a lot of controversy over whether it 's actually saying ` islam is the light ' or not , so i have to say this is probably just a gross overreaction . grow up , soccer moms !

NEG it 's an economic trap !
NEG i do n't see how it matters who does the talking , so long as what 's said is true . both sides are largely comprised of stupid politicians or evil politicians pandering to stupid voters .
NEG blacklabelsar , i appreciate your desire to join in the pile-on , but in this case you 're wrong . i 'm fully aware that godwin 's law simply states the probability of a nazi reference , and nothing else . however , as i 'm sure you are aware , the most common corollary to godwin 's law is that whoever makes the nazi comparison loses the discussion . <br> <br> 99 % of the time when godwin 's law is invoked , the person using it means the corollary . i do n't think it 's necessary or helpful to force everybody to say , ` the most common corollary to godwin 's law ! you lose ! ' it 's pedantic and artificial , and nothing is gained by it . <br> <br> lastly , i think you should all be grateful to me for providing you with such a comedy goldmine .

NEG it 's true thet world can end at any moment without warning . that 's why i always tell people exactly what i think of them because i may never get another chance .
NEG the first people hitler murdered on a large scale were the mentally handicapped as they did n't meet his expectations of a ` master race ' . the german people were furious and rose up against this aprobation and it soon stopped . the next group of people to be exterminated were not the jews or communists or homosexuals : it was the intelligentsia . the people who knew the program and where it was headed . some were teachers and university professors . today there are few teachers or professors in this country bright enough or deprogrammed enough to be a threat to anyone . however i was blessed to by surrounded by over 15,000 of the intelligentsia on 9/2/08 in st.paul , minnesota . and i knew it was just the tip of the iceberg . <br> hitler took everyone 's guns before the roundup so his pussy gestapo agents could do their job easier . does fema et al really think the real americans are as quick to surrender as the germans ? do they really think we 're going to go down without a fight ? <br> thanks for the post . do not stop talking about this to your fellow americans .

NEG are you thinking about those 10-10-220 , telephone commercials ? he talks about that here : <br> <br> ' i made an album in las vegas in the '60s , and a hippie friend said to me , ` man , you sold out . ' so i said , ` wait a minute , what is that over there ? ' and he said , ` it 's a phone , man . ' i said , ` that 's ma bell . you 're cooperating with them . you have one of their implements in your home . you sold out . ' by that i mean that this thing is on a scale . the alternative , the real pure path , is to live in the woods , make your own clothing , and perhaps eat small game , if you can catch it . you have to choose how much you 're willing to put up with for your purposes . so , i am a reluctant participant in the commercial world because that 's what they have here , that 's the way they keep score , and i 'm not about to go live in the woods . if this were a culture where everything was free , i would do this for free . i would go from campfire to campfire , dragging my stone tablet of jokes around for people to see in exchange for pieces of meat . it would be a nicer system . but that 's not the way it is . <br> that being said ... in the early '80s i discovered that i had made bad business decisions during the last half of the '70s and was deeply in debt to the irs . it was still 70 percent tax time . i was behind . the penalties and interest were burying me , and i had no career to speak of . so a friend of mine , a promoter , became my manager , and we began to dig out of this , and it 's taken me 20 years . when the people from 10-10-220 came to me , i said , ` well , it 's a phone service , it 's not a poison gas , it 's not gasoline , let me listen to these people . ' they gave me full creative control over the imagery and the content , and they wanted to use me doing my stand-up . so i made what i consider a compromise , or an adjustment . that 's my personal euphemism for it -- we all make adjustments to our value system according to our needs and what we can tolerate .

NEG national socially responsible health care !!! <br> whatwe need is nationalized health care that keeps all of the money sucking fat companies totally out of it . all the health care costs should be borne by the country itself since too much time and money is spent figuring out who is responsible for all the carcinogens , pesticides , and everything else in the country that has unknown side effects . and then adding profit margins , advertising , legal costs , ceo benefits onto the cost . not only that the profit motive makes the first priority of any company the avoidance of coverage as much as possible . that is an insane approach to the health and welfare of a nation and it 's national security . as we know we are all affected by the lack of treatment of diseases of everyone else ! in an interdependent system everyone needs to have good coverage . <br> it also seems to call in question the motivation of any form of insurance . <br>

NEG while these are all good points , if it is n't a project designed to be begun and completed in the short term then it is n't economic stimulus . that would be regular infrastructure building and such spending should be considered in other normal budgetary spending matters . the argument that ` this is our big chance to get a huge chunk of money ' does n't fly , we should not be any less critical of the spending in the stimulus package than we would be spending in the federal budget .

NEG sheesh , i thought the fight was tough in cali .
NEG ` thats the point ! ' <br> i am so happy to have the president stand up for the real world . a stimulus is spending . you can spend it on good things that create jobs or stupid things -LRB- like simple rebate checks -RRB- that do n't . that is a good debate . but 40 republican lawmakers do n't believe this simple fact and voted to remove all spending and replace it with huge tax cuts for rich individuals ! where is the middle ground with that ?

NEG i said this so long ago when houstonpress had 2 back to back articles that were just slideshows of about 100 photos or so , something that would never have made the frontpage because it required reloading the page 100 or moreso times to go through the set . also the site went from literally obscure to suddenly extremely popular with only recent submissions - as in no previous articles submitted from the site .
NEG would n't classify that as a debate ... he basically dumbs himself down enough to make anyone who ask him a serious question an ass . he really made tucker look like an ass but at the same point he ca n't answer a serious question with a serious answer .

NEG actually , in this time of economic hardship , it is good for the country to have a leader to look up to . obama 's mere presence in office is restoring american faith in the economy and will help to make things better . he is not an over night cure but he does a good job of giving us the faith in america we need right now . <br> <br> btw . as an obama supporter , i would be behind mccain had he won because we need a leader at this time in history and anyone willing to do the job deserves respect and admiration .

NEG , did you read this article ? or was it over your head ?
NEG ` the wording of stimulus bill says that government bailout money can not be used for churches -- it does not ban religious worship . ' <br> <br> the wording of the bill said nothing of the kind . i suggest you actually read the text of those couple of lines that demint was questioning , in context with the entire section of the american recovery and reinvestment act . <br> <br> priority funding is given to higher education facilities that have been included in a declared emergency . all the funds are administered through the state departments of higher education , and distributed in proportion to the number of students at each school . <br> <br> all schools receiving grants have to commit to spending 25 percent of the grant to projects that are certifiable under ` green ' building standards , such as the leed green building system , etc. . <br> <br> the grants are to be used for a wide variety of renovations and improvements ' ... that are primarily used for instruction , research , or student housing ... ' <br> <br> except <br> <br> -LRB- a -RRB- the maintenance of systems , equipment , or facilities , including maintenance associated with any permissible uses of funds described in paragraph -LRB- 1 -RRB- ; <br> <br> -LRB- b -RRB- modernization , renovation , or repair of stadiums or other facilities primarily used for athletic contests or exhibitions or other events for which admission is charged to the general public ; <br> <br> -LRB- c -RRB- modernization , renovation , or repair of facilities -- <br> <br> -LRB- i -RRB- used for sectarian instruction , religious worship , or a school or department of divinity ; or <br> <br> -LRB- ii -RRB- in which a substantial portion of the functions of the facilities are subsumed in a religious mission ; or <br> <br> -LRB- d -RRB- construction of new facilities . <br> <br> <br> so , while the money can be used for projects in facilities that are primarily used for instruction ... if the facility is primarily used for instruction in religion -LRB- such as a school of divinity -RRB- , then the grant money can not be used to renovate or improve that facility . at least 25 percent of the grant money has to be spent on green building projects . <br> <br> i 'm not certain if that bit in the bill is discriminatory , though it seems likely , as the wording is vague -LRB- how much usage is ` substantial ' ? -RRB- ; the government withholds money that would be granted for improvements to facilities used for any other type of instruction . <br> <br> not exactly equal treatment under the eyes of the lawmakers . <br> <br> demint appears to have been grandstanding with his proposed amendment : <br> <br> ` to allow the free exercise of religion at institutions of higher education that receive funding under section 803 of division a ' <br> <br> that said , i think the entire bill is a travesty , as you do n't get out of debt by digging ever deeper into your creditor 's pockets . <br> <br> the complete text of the bill : <br>

NEG there have been players who have cheated , bragged about cheating , got caught and punished , and still made it into the hall . <br> <br> optimally , you 'd be able to easily tell who 's in the hall and cheated and kick them out . then gather all that are eligible , find out if they cheated in any form , and let them pass through if they did n't . after that , make anyone who 's found cheating automatically ineligible . <br> <br> but the first part of that is impossible . so other than doing the impossible , there are going to be some cheaters who receive preferential treatment over others . and that 's bullshit . <br> <br> it 's fucked any way you slice it .
NEG while i disagree with ending the death penalty entirely , i certainly see a need to make it harder to impose . i have thought for a long time that we need a higher standard of ` proof ' than the ` beyond a reasonable doubt ' convictions we have right now . it is an overused word , but there are some jackals out there that are truly deserving of the word ` monster ' and when those deserving few are caught and ` scientifically ' proven to be guilty , our world is better off with them dead . <br> <br> would it help to have a full review the case after a conviction , but before the sentencing ? make sure the conduct of the police was completely above board , the prosecutors actually turned over all evidence as required , the defense was competent , the judge had no conflict of interest or political agenda and all the forensic tests were done by certified techs on properly calibrated equipment , etc. the conduct of all involved needs to be examined and if it is n't completely above reproach , then the death penalty is off the table and life without parole becomes the maximum sentence .

NEG misleading ? perhaps , but do n't judge the speaker harshly . it 's rather difficult to explain it succinctly and accurately to the layman . let me give it a shot . <br> <br> the fact is all our best descriptions of the universe treat time and space on a very similar footing . you may choose not to call time a dimension ; words are just words , so that 's your perogative . but in fact time is something very similar to a dimension , and in the mathematical sense of the word it certainly qualifies . <br> <br> in fact the basic difference is , time has a ` minus ' sign in a couple of key equations , while the three space dimensions each have a ` plus ' sign . -LRB- well , the other difference is it 's measured in years instead of meters , but that problem 's solvable . one light year is fundamentally one ` year ' of distance ; that 's why physicists use light years ! -RRB- <br> <br> now it 's true , that minus sign makes time a very different beast from space . but in a mathematical sense it 's still a dimension , and spacetime is a four-dimensional manifold of some strange structure we do n't know everything about yet .

NEG ` thank god laserdisc did n't catch on ' <br> <br> wtf ? first of all , it pretty much outlasted vhs . more importantly , it was about the best consumer-electronics product ever . at a time when video tape had barely made it into homes , philips and pioneer had the guts to develop and commercialize a laser-based optical disc system . in the '70s . let 's see : uncompressed video , stereo -LRB- and , later , dolby ac-3 -RRB- sound , directors ' cuts , extras -LRB- some even had the entire script of the film on the disc -RRB- . and no wear . and selling for $ 35 per movie , when crappy , mono , quickly worn-out vhs tapes were selling for $ 100 . <br> <br> laserdisc could have topped dvd 's picture quality if it had offered anamorphic and progressive images , because it was uncompressed . its primary disadvantage would 've been video noise level . <br> <br> hopefully your friends and family do n't rely on you for electronics advice .
NEG someone track down an address , email , phone number , something that we can write to this police department and speak our minds .
NEG that whole fraud of ` sea ice back ' has been repeatedly exposed as nothing but more denier lies : <br>
NEG this new york times article this article is sourced from is laughable . <br> <br> sirius xm might get rid of howard stern ?? really ? because i 'm pretty sure he 's a driving force behind the company , if not the driving force at this point .
POS onlywire.com is an awesome website for the entrpeneur who is making his first step in the business world . check it out .
POS marijuana appears to slow everything . EMO_HAPPY
NEG i just did . why is my comparison wrong ? just saying it does n't make it so . <br> <br> also , i figured you do n't support slavery , i 'm just showing why the reason you 're cool with prop 8 is totally bogus . like , it 's a fake reason . <br> <br> and marriage actually is considered a fundamental right . it 's considered part of your right to privacy .
NEG i feel sorry for you 360 owners , one day you 'll be able to afford a real pc .
NEG wrong there have been almost no war in which the 2 sides had the same religion .
NEG i 'm on the side of the free staters , you ninnies ! house resolutions are one thing . actually defending yourself from a belligerent federal government is something else entirely . several states have brought up this ` declare sovereignty ' thing and what does it change ? they all still take federal money for their schools , permit unconstitutional federal agencies to meddle in their citizens ' lives , and roll over for the exact same jurisdictional power grabs as always . <br> <br> what a state * really * needs to do in order for all this celebrating to be justified , is to pass a law that flies directly in the face of unconstitutional federal policies , and back it up with lethal force . for example , new hampshire could decriminalize marijuana , and arrest any federal agent that attempts to harass anyone for possession .
POS michael phelps i 'm pulling a bong ripp for ya . <br>
POS because i wo n't have to carry 15 books on a 3 week vacation ! if i minded reading from a screen i would n't be on digg right now ! i can read the advance readers copy of my favorite authors new book several months before it printed , by getting the earc from webscriptions ! there are many novels that are available only as ebooks !!
NEG just saw this yesterday . <br> <br> you should also see this :
POS building a good friend list and being active daily is the key .
NEG fap fap fffffsssorry , what ?
NEG we did n't start the fire .
NEG one word : redskunk .
POS so , let 's discuss then . robots ? i 'm for robots ... ninja robots that look like thomas jefferson .
NEG what amazes me is why this is on digg ? vw bluemotion cars have been around for years .
NEG it does n't have to be a nonprofit , or big volunteer effort . it 's the little miracles , the little bits of compassion and energy that we give to others that accumulate in personal excellence everyday and amount to growth of character and strength in spirit . do unto others is not just an adage but a way of being . and this is n't just for weekend warriors . think about it the next time you step over a homeless person in the street on your way to where ever .
NEG the final statement shows that the chief is more concerned about damage control and protecting his ` brothers ' than what really happened on that video . a history of violence does n't excuse excessive force by the officers on that day . i wish more police actually care about justice .
NEG ha , that 's a fucking accomplishment right there . finding few-year-old files , it 's quite impressive , although understandable . <br> <br> the biggest fuck up i 've had was accidentally the whole hard drive . i was actuall going to a floppy drive , but i was talking on the phone , distracted , selected the wrong drive , and few clicks later , my hard drive was formatted . i realized that when i saw that file system was set to ntfs , and i was like ` ntfs on a floppy ? wtf ? ' a microsecond later i felt like shooting myself . <br> <br> 80gb of data , including downloads , mp3s , movies . over 48 hours trying to recover that shit . i got back like 50 % , mostly due to the lack of decent free software at the time .
POS i respect your honesty .
NEG ` easily doable ... ' <br> <br> like your mom ! xd <br> <br> sorry .
NEG sure he did smokey .
NEG it is so much more than a media player , and the player part comes unlocked . can vlc render straight into a podcast format ? can it create . mov and . m4v ? mixed with flip4mac can it render . wmv ? can windows movie player do any of the above ? <br> <br> actually can the rather otherwise awesome widows media tool you can download for free convert into . mov or . m4v ? i think not , wether you pay extra or not . <br> <br> i paid for it , and have used it 's features to make money since . ca n't remember last time i used it to watch a video , and their lies the reasoning i 'm sure . <br> <br> if it 's unlocked , i wuld have thought watching video through itunes on a mac is making quicktime irrelevant except for rendering video or watching . wmv -LRB- a format that is quickly being made pointless -RRB- . quicktime pro mixed with flip4mac studio is an incredibly powerful and inexpensive tool for a video maker . <br> <br> frankly , people moaning about quicktime are not using it to full potential ... or are mac haters jumping on their silly bandwagon . <br> <br> no idea what you are talking about people . <br> <br>
NEG i believe it 's spelled ` respeck ' .
NEG reminds me of what my big brother used to do to me .
NEG if your own community is filled with selfish folks like yourself , not willing to help out -LRB- note : i did n't say give up your own food supply -RRB- your fellow neighbors , then you guys wo n't last a year . <br> <br> good luck to you .
NEG <br> 1 out of 6 is some progress <br> <br> / no , even mcdonald 's salads and apple slices have 24 grams of trans-fat . xd
NEG if we use california as a microcosim of what liberal government can do -LRB- do n't even try to claim that schwarzy is a real conservative -RRB- then i think we can clearly see where the us will be after 8 years of obama . i do n't know what kind of weed they smoke in washington but the idea that we can spend -LRB- aka print -RRB- our way out of this is patently retarded . the government can not fix with one payment what it has spent 40 years creating with bad legislation and spending . sadly even ending the war really wo n't help . sure we 'd save all those billions by not having troops abroad , but then we 'd have all those troop back home ... looking for jobs ... where there are n't any .
NEG is it just me or does a guy say ` fuck you ' during the news report when they switch to the blond girl ?
NEG also notice in commericals now that any ` bad person ' is a 30 something clean cut white male . they got them breaking into houses and taking a break from jogging to sift through your trash to steal your identity .
NEG enough with the hate-mongering . anything that panders to a stereotype is not ` hate speech ' . yes , women have pms . yes , men double up if they get kicked in the balls . neither observation is hateful . <br> <br> most of these commercials would work well enough with a man/boy as the protagonist too . they are not sexist , just implying their customers are dumb . i remember a commercial where a man was apparently too dumb to work a water filter , and the woman showed him how , smugly . that is sexist , but apparently there is only outcry if the roles are reversed . -LRB- of course , it would be sexist the other way round too -RRB- <br> <br> and of course , i concede the polyglas tire one is completely sexist and demeaning , but how old does that have to be , 40 years or more ?
NEG found this pretty interesting : <br> <br> male bashing in tv <br> <br> just shows how a lot of comedies/sitcoms have a male lead who is an idiot/poor parent/etc . and how in between the commercials have an anti-man vibe to em . <br> <br> thought it was interesting to go against the tv hates women vein .
NEG digg lefties ca n't handle the truth

POS poitier was the man .
NEG down in orange county the cops just ship the homeless off from the rich neighborhoods -LRB- irvine -RRB- to the poorer cities -LRB- santa ana -RRB-
NEG no . it 's not . what we have here are bad decisions by people playing with money that is not theirs . then , when the bill comes due , we get forced to pay for their bad decisions . the only way out of this spiral is called fiscal responsibility . which is n't going to happen as long as we worship greed in this country .
NEG like fdr said : we have to ` make -LSB- them -RSB- do it . '
NEG perhaps you should focus your anger less on this ` piece of shit ' show and more on your diminutive brain size ? it seems this show is much too complicated for someone of your iq to comprehend .
NEG what the fuck indeed .
NEG even though 120 - something baseball players have tested positive for steroids , i think it 's awesome that everyone is jumping over a-rod . way to be a bunch of haters , non-yankees fans . <br> <br> see you in october . <br> what 's left of you .
POS i 'm surprised to say this , but i may actually retire my pirate xp for a legit w7
NEG that was weak . i feel like the whole darth vader character swap thing was played out a few years ago already . <br>
NEG i didnt digg you down , but question : <br> <br> when has obama upheld the constitution ?
POS ha ha this is pretty cool . here is one i enjoyed . <br> <br> 174 the world 's biggest pyramid is not in egypt , but in mexico
POS laugh out loud at their pricing scheme ... quarterly payments of x % of the developer 's sales . .
POS good post darcine ! there are whiners on the left and blowhards on the right - but they need each other . they cancel each other out and keep each other in check . this causes the nation to be centrist over time . <br> <br> benjamin franklin knew this and talked about it frequently .
NEG . net should be ditched and mono should rise , meaning c people should code toward mono and not . net . in term what this will do is force microsoft out of ownership of the c coding language . then by c having no owner it can become as standard as c or c++ that in terms will help developers and ` all ' users . <br> <br> i admit i had a problem against c because the fact . net , closed and propetiary , is the main implementation of it . though with an open implementation combo of c / gtk / qt -LRB- its called something else -RRB- i noticed this is actually a good thing , except for the fact mono is trying ot be a 100 % clone of . net and not try to surpass it that is an issue . <br> <br> basically what i want to see happen with mono is that it integrates functions and parts from all over into it , basically anyone who builds extentions to mono-c do n't hesitate to begin integrating these things in the mainline design . <br> <br> so pretty much if mono continues to be brain dead step child of . net then i ca n't truly support c , but if people force mono as the c standard then its well worth it .
NEG nice to see all the huffpo tards are getting paid to game digg .
NEG i suspect they watched the movie ' 21 ' too many times . unfortunately because they suck at math , they devised their own ` genius ' way of becoming infamous . it 's too bad they did n't have kate bosworth with them to tell them when to get out .
NEG this is your biography <br>

NEG of course , the joke was n't about digg , it was about reddit .
POS <br> nail on the head right there . nail on the head .
NEG sorry ... did n't show up in the duplicate checker , looks like it was about 6 minutes apart . i honestly try not to submit duplicates and rarely do . <br> <br> and what makes kotaku 's post that is based on a press release ` blogspam ' but your submission -LRB- a blog which did the exact same thing -RRB- somehow more worthy ?
NEG i glad our national media is covering this . it sad that this is being reported by a uk paper , just sad
NEG she 's 41 ! yowza !
POS praying is the only real cure !
NEG that 's a strange statement you 've just made . it 's almost like you 're accusing him of doing something wrong even though he could n't help himself .
NEG you brute .
NEG im pretty sure the world would still spin if mac 's never existed .
NEG for something to be visible , light must bounce off it and be reflected back into our eyes . since light can not escape it , there 's no way for it to be reflected , thus making the black hole invisible .
NEG screw verison . screw at & t. bring it to t-mobile !

NEG nuke iran
NEG why ? believe it or not , some of what he submits is actually interesting .
NEG was n't that funny .
NEG in order to get gregg to sign on , obama promised gregg he would get the pork out of the so-called stimulus , and he would do a fair and square census . when the grievance mongers started squealing , obama went back on the census promise and turned it over to rahm ` hit-man ' emmanuel . no warning to gregg . then pork-a palooza happened , with obama fighting for every slice of bacon . gregg figured out obama could n't be trusted , and he got out while the getting was good .

NEG if by nobel prize winner you mean paul krugman , you are a lying liar . krugman is in full support of nationalization . try reading some of his recent op-ed 's .
NEG you 've missed the point completely . the cap on pay was for companies that received bailout money . <br> <br> this ` top talent ' that is bitching about getting their million-dollar salaries have obviously done absolutely nothing to make their company profitable , they 've allowed their company to get to the point where they need a bailout . <br> <br> christ , that word has become so common now everyone uses it with disregard . this country really is getting fucked up by greed .
NEG there 's a chapter in the book freakonomics all about drug gang business structure and economics . <br> <br> basically , it 's a franchise system , much like macdonalds , with the street dealers = burger flipping johnny no-stars on $ 4/hr , franchise managers = bmw driving execs , and columbians as ceos . <br> <br> <br>
NEG okay he wants to temporarily take them over , well that makes it much better / s <br> <br> one thing i 've learned is once power is in washington it is very hard to get back . give them an inch and they take a mile , look at the patriot act , income tax ... he is putting way too much trust in a government/party he is sceptical of . i 'm sorry , it wo n't work and if they get control of the banks they will not give them up without a fight .
NEG do n't blame me , i voted for ron paul .
NEG umm ... woz does n't work for apple .
NEG my opinion , summed up quite nicely : <br> <br> ` with or without religion , you would have good people doing good things and evil people doing evil things . but for good people to do evil things , that takes religion . ' <br> - steven weinberg <br> <br> not all religious people are evil , but religion makes it a lot easier for people to justify evil actions .

POS it 's nice to see informed comments :-RRB- <br> thanks ! <br> <br>
NEG the basis for comparison does n't hold up . a regular user can go trough 3 lines of coke in about as much time as a drunk takes a swig of beer . so it might be $ 4 - $ 8 a line but you 'll end up doing 15-20 a night -LRB- a cokehead 's night can end at 3 pm the next day -RRB- so if you say that the average drunk will drink 10 beers in a night at about $ 5 a beer . the cokehead can be out anywhere from 10 - 110 bucks a night over someone just drinking . so it is definitely not cheaper than beer in a real sense .
NEG but where is the mac mini ? i only see a dell .

NEG i 'm right there with you , in addition i feel i have a moral obligation -LRB- yes , morals have nothing to do with religion -RRB- to point out the wrong doings of religion . it 's just not right to control people through their insecurities about life and fear of death . <br> <br> ' i call christianity the one great curse , the one great intrinsic depravity , the one great instinct of revenge , for which no means are venomous enough , or secret , subterranean and small enough - i call it the one immortal blemish upon the human race . ' - nietzsche -LRB- and i agree with him -RRB-
NEG i study in law school and have been to a few criminal law classes . studies show that certain psychiatric treatments do lower the change of re-offending on specif group of convicted criminals . these kinds of programs are n't really used in the usa since its criminal justice system has opted for the punishment angle instead of the rehabilitation angle .

NEG this is what the australian federal government wants to put onto every australian internet user and it 'll be a mandatory filter with a opt-out filter on top of it , this madness of the highest order , complete foolishness but the government is n't listening to the voters for reasons best known to others .
NEG * questions ... like this ?
POS that is actually a really good question even though you were just kidding around -LRB- or was it that bad ? -RRB- . i am currently working on a undergrad psych degree and the issue of implanting false memories has come up in many of my courses , but nothing has ever been mentioned about making someone forget past memories . although i suppose you can try to suppress your past memories on your own if you believe in that whole freudian thing .
POS we are the final boss .
NEG who gives a crap ! i love google , it does what i need it to do and i use gmail entirely for my email needs . anyone who bitch and moans about google being in ` beta ' will bitch and moan about it even if it is the final release . they always want to hate something ... if this was apple i bet they will say how much innovation it is that apple stays in beta forever ... new people suck !
NEG you can say that about anything . if you 're so worried about malaria , sell your computer and get volunteering .
NEG i posted this to the wrong video . it should have gone to the video the opelz posted just about this one . i do n't know how it happened . <br> <br> i am ashamed . EMO_HAPPY
NEG i have come to the conclusion that every god damned person on the internet slept through the section of their english class that covers proper use of the apostrophe . <br> <br> fear 's = possessive case - fear becomes the object in possession . -LRB- incorrect , as ` fear 's ' is a noun in this case -RRB- <br> fears = verb , ` fears ' gives action to taliban , making the sentence complete . -LRB- also incorrect ... -RRB- <br> fear = verb , but now in singular form . -LRB- correct case -RRB- <br> <br> so not only was the apostrophe not needed , but the plural form was incorrect as well . <br> <br> i realize there are other errors , but i am getting really fucking sick of people ignoring basic grammar principles and bastardizing the english language . normally i can handle the occasional slip-up , but this shit is seriously getting out of control .
NEG yeah i know kind of raging at all of the comments claiming they would murder the stupid kid over a cat <br> <br> maybe i just do n't have the love for felines you people do after seeing the remains of a baby killed by a cat
NEG that movie has so outrageous errors it is funny in a ` plan 9 from outer space ' kind of way . <br> freezing cold air from the top of the clouds comes down and shock freezes everything , because suddenly the basic laws of thermodynamics stop applying and the air stays cold despite the higher pressure on the ground . .

NEG you 're an idiot , zendez1 . you have no idea what you are talking about . do you honestly care what happens to these assholes ? personally , i would n't feel bad if they got killed somehow .
POS that ` yummy ' theme looks like a tiger app . the default theme looks correctly leopard-ish .

POS made in the us ;--RRB-
NEG honestly i really hope these idiots get whats coming to them , this is just so wrong on sooo many levels , i really hope they dont get just a slap on the wrist they need some serious consequences !
NEG guess that ` splains the comment getting dugg down ... <br> <br> i forget sometimes that mob mentality rules , even on teh internets <br> <br>
POS i do n't work . i do n't have kids . i do what i want , when i want - i am free .

NEG needs more bacon
POS 100 billion trillion earth-like planets containing life . amazing . now how about the other planets that have sentience that is n't defined by the term of ` life ' as we know it ?
NEG amazing -- the power of an orbiting fleck of paint . the velocities these particles achieve is astounding . it would seem that ` kessler ' was right - and attention needs to be given to the space debris problem . somehow , i ca n't quite avoid picturing a scenario where warring countries decide to blow up each other 's communications satellites . a lot of our military weaponry and defense systems rely on satellites for gps and remote controls , and our abm systems depend on an intact communication system . so far , russia , us , and china have all shown that they can blow a satellite to smithereens . so if star wars ever gets here , there will likely be too much resulting particulate matter for normal space capability to survive .
NEG i dugg you up , and then read ' i am sure anyone who behaves like this has suffered much to become like they are . ' and promptly dugg you back down . <br> <br> no , this kid probably did n't suffer fuck all . chances are this kid is a sociopath . even if he did suffer in life , it 's no fucking excuse for this .
POS can there please be a blue screen of death theme park ride ? please ?
NEG also known as a ` mini-layoff '
NEG and you wonder how the nazi 's could find people to run they 're camps . i 'm appalled to why the military did not protect the people from a government that behaves like this . when basic liberties are removed and enforced this way by the government and military its own people are the next victims . how many young dead americans soldiers now ? the military should invade that ranch in texas instead and go after the real problems ...
NEG obama stated many times on his campaign that he wanted to give more funding to churches and to empower them to help to their communities . i do n't know why anybody is surprised by this move . did you actually listen to what obama was saying and read about his policy during the campaign or just buy into the ultra left wing image that the media and republicans painted of him ? <br> <br> also , despite what you may think , most churces are not the rabid evangelical type and do a lot of good for their communities , especially in inner cities . obama made his early political career as a community organizer working alongside churches . this is exactly in line with his character .
NEG how many times did the article mention ` occupation ' ? <br> <br> zero .
POS mccain has run for president several times and refused to release his records from college or the military . dumbya did n't release his either , they were leaked . we still have n't seen that glowing record of his awol years from the national guard . <br> <br> an no one , i mean no one is even considered for harvard law without exceptional records . to be on the harvard law review is reserved for only the top students and to be top dog , editor , we can safely assume that obama never took a ` history of television ' course in under grad for an easy grad and that he never received as much as an a - in anything he did . face it , he worked his ass off and he is a very smart man .
POS some interesting thoughts concerning christopher reeve 's superman
NEG unfortunately i feel this was her death sentence
NEG coming to bat for louisiana , theamazingkort . <br> <br> well , i have to agree that this is definitely a leap backwards for how the rest of the nation thinks of louisiana . but just like everywhere else , there are probably going to be more idiots than there are rational thinkers . included in those idiots just so happens to be our governor . it 's a sad state of affairs , but it 's a reality for us . i , and many others i know , do not and have not ever supported bobby jindal in his decisions to do anything and i for sure did n't vote for the guy . <br> <br> so i 'm asking nicely , please do n't pigeon hole all louisiana residents , some of us are smart enough to wipe our own asses .
NEG bush had been getting intelligence reports since he was elected - 11 months before 9/11 occurred . 9/11 happened during bush 's presidency plain and simple . he had plenty of time to do something . beyond that , just because clinton dropped the ball does n't actually excuse the fact bush was reading my pet goat during 9/11 , i call this kindergarten ethics . thank god you nut jobs were voted out - say hello to reality gop .
NEG - the bible is the word of god written by man . it is a true collection of stories written as lessons . you do n't have to take the actual words literally to be a believer . i am a christian but i do n't think that the heavens , earth and everything was created in 7 , literal , days . seven days could be tens or hundreds of thousands , or millions , of years . ` soon ' is given as the time when jesus will return and we all know that soon to us obviously is n't ` soon ' to god as it 's been a couple thousand years so far . as an engineer i am well aware of the mountains of evidence of evolution and fully believe it to be true as well . the two are not mutually exclusive . <br> <br> you will say that it awfully convenient that we ca n't prove god exists . but i tell you this ... it 's awfully convenient that something is either fully , literally , true or it is n't true at all . i think you need to think more fully , and critically , about the possibilities that exist rather than claiming something is n't true because there is no proof , without any proof of your own .
NEG better living through nihilism !
POS super mario bros showed us how platformers should play , super mario world showed us how beautiful a mario game could look , mario 64 came out and said ` woo ! 3d ! ' but galaxy is the first one that pretty much nailed all of it and still remained fun . i do n't think i have wanted to put the controller down at any time while playing galaxy . <br> <br> super mario galaxy is the best mario game . possibly one of the best of any game . <br> <br> except alex kidd in miracle world ...
NEG facebook , who cares . . sad muppets vying to be more popular than each other . stupid applications and even more ridiculous status updates . load of old bollocks ! <br> <br> burried for containing the word facebook !
POS well , he 's allowing someone else to present their case . in the interview he questions executive pay caps . he does actually argue the case of the executive . however , you do make a good point .
NEG and i think you are a slanderous and ignorant fool , mostly because rush does n't use drugs any longer . great how free speech works , is n't it ? i mean , where else can all the people who do n't know anything get to talk and then i can show up and show them how ignorant they are ? i love it !
NEG i 'm glad someone remembers that poor little boy torn from a nation of freedom and sent back to castro .
NEG what the fuck happened to the hippocratic oath ? any actual doctor doing that brings disgrace to the entire medical community .
NEG the human being created civilization not because of willingness but of a need to be assimilated into higher orders of structure and meaning . the individual desires judgment . without that desire , the cohesion of groups is impossible , and so is civilization . first , judgment came from the gods . then , it came from celebrity -LRB- the observation and judgment of others -RRB- . now we can implement the same functionality with data-mining algorithms - our next judge will probably be an omni-present self-aware system that we build ourselves , which eerily echos voltaire .
NEG i have to agree with the jackson thing , and if we agree that the effectiveness of an administration is the benchmark , then you may have to put george bush in the top 10 . <br> <br> you may not like his policy , but he damn sure got it done . <br>
POS was not even surprised read wii first EMO_HAPPY

NEG beat me to it .
NEG god damn patent wars .
NEG buried , as i did n't see any nuke go off . you can make any zombie dance to rick astley .
NEG umm , the corporate world is not like the consumer world . none of the servers we buy at american express ` come with windows server ' preinstalled , we must pay for a license for every server we install it on . <br> <br> what planet are you on ? <br> <br>
POS ca n't wait to see pics ... i 'm either getting a marq or borg as my next gun
NEG we have conclusive proof that that priest is harboring weapons of mass destruction . <br> <br> oh and it 's not ` alliance ' . it 's ` coalition of the willing ' now .
NEG wtf , this article and this comment thread is a perfect example of whatever the article writer is talking about , of which i have no idea . is this really a problem for anyone who is n't well entrenched in the gaming industry ? i have no idea what the writer is talking about as he cites no examples , and it amazes me that everyone on this thread is more or less agreeing also without providing any examples except for yahtzee . maybe i 'm just not ` in the know ' , even though i read at least 3-4 gaming sites daily ?
POS dugg for cute bear :d
NEG spoiler alert : you will die alone . <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> not directed at you , 007kz .
NEG i 'd like to take her for a test drive to check the tatt personally ...
NEG * loser . <br> i 'm leaving the ad hominem attack alone , but where are you conjuring this fear of ` they 'll take mah guns ' from ? any source ? or are you just like all the fat white sellers i saw at the last gun show i was at ?
NEG the us post office posted a $ 5.1 billion loss in 2008 . if the post office really needs people to run their company into the ground , my 5-year old could probably do a damn fine job of it , and he 'll only charge $ 400 -LRB- the cost of a lego death star -RRB- , not $ 800,000 .
NEG another statement from the writer of the blogpost : <br> <br> ` worse yet , the noise-makers on the blogs are attacking marcia for demanding justice in this case because they think she 's attacking muslims . ' <br>
NEG cv , books , patents , video , conferences , workshops , expedition , iumab , research <br>
NEG if this had michael phelps in the title , it would probably be number one right now .
POS yeah commenting about digg on digg is unrelated <br> gold star .
NEG the current beer tax in oregon , according to the story i saw on the news , said the current tax is less than one cent per pint . while i 'd say -LRB- as an oregonian and a beer drinker -RRB- this is too minimal , and i * would * support a tax increase -LRB- we have such a budget shortfall here they 're talking about closing all the public schools in april because we ca n't afford to keep 'em open -RRB- , an 1800 % jump is n't a reasonable amount in my book . <br> <br> it should be stated for the record that a barrel of beer equals two kegs , so a $ 50 tax per barrel works out to $ 25 per 15.5 gallon keg , or about 20 cents per pint at a bar . <br> <br> of course , area brewers here are claiming it 's going to raise the cost of a pint by $ 2 , which is ridiculous .
NEG sorry , not the case . this cop did everything he could to get phelps arrested , but in the end there just was not enough evidence . a picture of an empty bong , without showing pot in it , without showing phelps inhaling , and without an admission of smoking pot will go nowhere in court and the cop knows this . <br> <br> do n't give the guy any extra credit .
NEG 72 % of the 49 % of the 27 % when including the 18 % of the stereotype group of 19 % . . these studies do n't mean jack . <br> <br> first of all you 're ` surveying ' which means the information is already twisted by the people answering , second of all your group is insignificantly small compared to overall gaming audience which skews the results even further . <br> <br> with no indication of where the group was picked -LRB- as in what part of the fantastic little globe of ours -RRB- it skews the results even further - certain parts of the world seem to be in constant state of depression anyway , judging by the medical sales at least .
NEG i think prostitue is some kind of foreign word .
NEG he 's some friend to stick around and help a friend being robbed . i actually know some people that would back away and yell advice , or run . <br> <br> this one guy i know , he 's not my friend , but three other friends and i lured him into the woods and then one of the friends appeared out of nowhere and started ` raping ' our other friend . three to one , you 'd think the plan would be to take the ` rapist ' on , but no , this guy was scared shitting bricks and wanted to run . then again the fact he does n't respect women 's rights and stuff might have been a factor . still , i would n't depend on him to stand up to a five year old . i do n't think he ever went near the woods again .
NEG the rest is protectionist claptrap . it does not seem to occur to buchanan that jobs are lost and gained in a vibrant economy . prior to this depression , we lost a huge number of manufacturing jobs because of automation . according to dr. sowell , china lost the same percentage of manufacturing jobs that we did . <br> <br>
NEG it was the individual who believed the cat ` felt there was something wrong . ' and you 're debating on the cats ` knowledge ' ?! now , if you 're really paying attention you 'll put together a few things ; notice that it is mentioned the cancer was in an early stage , and could have gone undetected for five or more months . the cats behavior must have seemed random or spontaneous to the individual -LRB- hence his concern being triggered by an event which was n't normal -RRB- . you can very reasonably assume that cat may have sensed a * difference * in the owners ` state ' from one point in time to another . the cat does n't need to think there 's something ` wrong , ' i 'm sure if the cats senses were capable of detecting oder from the cancer then it was simply recognizing and curious about a change , nothing more . <br> <br> the question of ` good ' or ` bad ' is irrelevant , it 's people who determine that subjectively , well all animals eventually learn it hence being able to avoid danger . it could be just a coincidence , albeit an incredible one , the cats behavior was apparantly as ` recently odd ' as the cancer within this individuals lungs . <br> <br> it 's possible this is a coincidence , and evidence from research suggests it may not be . i 'm not going to make a decision either way , i 'll just appreciate the new information i 've been able to consume and learn more about it in time . <br> <br> the important question is ; ` could the cat have detected the cancer ? ' - where on the body the cat was scratching is the only place i see the greatest possibility for coincidence . the detection of the cancer itself may very well have been real and without the need for the cat to ` believe it was a bad thing . ' <br> <br> imho .
NEG the usps is an obsolete , useless organization . <br> 90 % of what they deliver is junk mail that clutters the house !

NEG english fail !
NEG i hate mac users because they think they are better than everyone else . <br> apple 's next campaign : we are for the snobby people who have bigger credit balances . <br> <br> btw , being in college and majoring in digital media , i do n't drive tractors anymore . i should change my username . i have not done a project yet that pc alternative software could not do .

NEG psn users ? all eight of them ? you bastard !
POS utorrent has a google filetype : torrent search box on their site EMO_HAPPY
NEG 1 - not a land grab ? what is it then ? a continuation of the statuesque ? <br> 2 - what if hamas claims they are targeting military targets ? therefore and civilian damage would just be collateral . just like israel claims . <br> 3 - democracy means you can vote for anyone you want . <br> 4 - perhaps they would negotiate if you took them off that stupid list and actually attempted to talk with them , you know like people ? <br> 5 - britain had a conscience
NEG does a picture of their face count as real information ?
NEG frost-bush in theaters soon <br> i 'm not a crook !

NEG why did n't they put the engine and propeller in the back ? that thing would be a bit windy for the driver/passenger in that configuration .
NEG so i guess what happens in the barracks does n't stay in the barracks after all .
NEG that seems reasonable for such a unique domain name . maybe the government will purchase it off the guy to help bail out the porn industry .
NEG it 's time to stop playing the blame game . what bush has done might have been bad but i honestly believe in obama 's message of bipartisanship and understanding . everything we do should be for the state , and a case against bush would divide the country in twain -LRB- yes , i just wanted to say ` twain ' -RRB- . a case like that would make it difficult for any republicans -LRB- who answer to their constituency -RRB- to work on economic packages with democrats . <br> <br> i do n't think it 's fair to let bush off the hook , but right now his ` crimes ' are less important than saving our economy , soldiers , and rights .
NEG i have a nose-picker 's cold right now .
NEG and heavies with natascha !
NEG you were every person in this thread
NEG global warming = what lay people say <br> global climate change = what 's really going on .

NEG esstee , <br> <br> read the article . <br> he was n't attacked by his animal . <br> he was attacked by two other chimps at the facility . <br> his chimp was n't even wild ... it was domesticated . <br> <br> there is no moral to this story other than the perseverance of the human spirit .
NEG i went to an all you can eat chinese in leeds uk , they had a section for english people and a section for the chinese , that section had chickens feet and stuff .
NEG huge moral hazard . the more they give you , the bigger the problem will be , as it artificially influences the housing market and encourages bad spending for short term gains and huge long term losses , not only from the buyers , but those who own the properties or intend to invest , particularly in low income housing construction . it will lead to a housing stagflation .
NEG if you look up you 'll find a post of his .
NEG kinseyincanada : yeah so anyone with a cell phone should just throw it away and get the motofone f3 , is that right ?

NEG i agree , it 's spam .
NEG shame about the chimp but i 'm a little more sad about the woman who lost her face .
NEG no just some boner that walks on water
POS for the record , those are fungi , not plants . <br> <br> granted , they are sexy fungi .
NEG i have deep concerns . as much as we need speed to fix the policies which authorized the many abuses of civil liberties the decisions need to be tempered with an aim to the future to prevent these abuses from happening again . having said that , the president has made some decisions which are clearly contrary to the goal of restoring all civil liberties , eliminating the poisonous policies and protecting us in the future . <br> <br> i intend to continue to read about his decisions and if they do not show a clear direction toward restoration of our civil liberties very soon i am likely to be marching in the streets with the ` radicals . ' <br> <br> and after reading the testimony of spc. brandon neely and realizing that we still have people who have been in those cages -LRB- see the picture in the following -RRB- for 6 or 7 years every day counts . <br> this is not just a national embarrassment it becomes a crime to which all of us are a party if we do not take steps to urge our elected officials to take action . and to open investigations and prosecutions .
NEG acorn-are you kidding me ? where do you get your news from ? rushycontin ? clownhall?faux news ? acorn gets no money-retard .
NEG the federal government has no legal right to own or restrict the use of land in sovereign states . that is one of the reasons washington d.c. was created .
NEG in general ?
NEG the 50 's and 60 's had the highest percentage of union jobs in american history . it was also when americans as a whole had the highest standard of living and the country was at the height of its prosperity . unions increase wages , which increase consumption , which stimulate production , which increases wealth . you do the math . the reaganomics idea that making people poor somehow benefits the economy ... well , we 've seen how that 's worked out , have n't we ?
NEG that was just a rumor at the time .
NEG i do n't know . maybe we should ask the internet companies why they ca n't keep up with demands for more bandwidth by upgrading our country 's infrastructure since , you know , the government pays them to do it .

NEG ` the assertion that some of the spending in the bill is n't stimulus ' <br> media matters thinks that anytime the government spends money on anything that stimulates the economy . in economics this is called the fallacy of the broken windows . the idea that if a store gets it 's windows broken and has to fix them this stimulates the economy . <br> <br> not true . the storeowner has to spend money , but if not for the broken window he could have spent that money on something else . <br> <br> does media matters believe the government should pay people to dig holes and then fill them in ? imagine how many people that would put to work ? of course , that 's silly . but in the same way , we believe , and fox news explains , that spending on useless projects is not stimulative . <br> <br> government spending projects did n't work in the 30s . did n't work in japan in the 90s . never worked in the now-defunct soviet union . it 's really never worked . and it 's crazy to gamble everything we have on the chance that the very first time in history that it will work would be now .
NEG libs ... always emotional , always race baiting . . an idiot is someone who voted for and signed a bill that nobody even read . . the dems love to bypass the normal procedures to push their liberal agendas by back handed tactics like this or putting activist justices on the bench . they hate to have things -LRB- like the things written into this pork/stimulus bill -RRB- actually go through the proper legislative process so we all would see what is being proposed and debated then voted on . . <br> <br> they insult the constitution and every american ... even if they had to find new people to write the bill , it would be the same bs by the same extreme radical leftost partisan democrats . . too bad . i left the party because of the leftist/marxists who are in charge now ... they all are embarrassments to the party and the country . . sharpton is one of the biggest embarrassment . the american people made a big mistake on election day and maybe now they will be finding out the truth and buyers remorse will set in . .
NEG this is insane . that makes their reviews useless . man , i used to like yelp .
NEG gfe
NEG no it is blind irrational religious hatred . <br> <br> alot of ethnic groups have been kicked around and denied their piece of the pie , but you do n't see cyprots generally in the streets yelling ` death to the turk ' or tibetans ` death to the chinese ' calls .
NEG obviously they do n't know russian and they are trying to make something funny .
NEG at the bottom of the page is an ad for stainless steel water bottles
NEG if only all the ph.d. economists had bothered to check with you before moving forward , everything would be ok . it 's such a shame that you 're on the internet , typing in all caps , instead of at the upper echelons of government , saving the world .
NEG ` when it was movie industry lawyer monique wadsted 's turn , she wasted no time in unexpectedly introducing new evidence . both the defense and the court complained at this point , with wadsted choosing to shout down the judge . ' <br> <br> i love that the industry ca n't seem to lose this trial fast enough . it 's almost like they think that if this goes badly , they 'll get another shot or just move onto the next high profile case . somebody needs to clue these assholes in that this is the superbowl . there is no other game after this . lose this case , and the coffin is nailed shut for good . <br> the whole thing os a joke , i mean tpb 's front page as of yesterday was , ' i iz kingkong ! i can haz torrentz ?

NEG so the enviro whacks and politically correct wannabes in government think that someone is going to sell off a perfectly good vehicle that they own and has payments of $ 0.00 / month so they can go into debt to the tune of $ 20,000 - $ 40000 just to ` save ' on fuel costs and taxes ? once again -LRB- as usual -RRB- the sqeaking wheels are living in their own version of reality . <br> gas isnt going to stay cheap forever . offer the vehicles that get better mileage at a reasonable price , not the price of a split-level home . if need be , subsidise them to keep the $ $ within reason . apply tax cuts to encourage purchases . its amazing how things can happen automatically with honey rather than vinegar . <br> <br>
NEG we 're going to have the 2 party system for many years to come , not much you or i can do about it . <br> <br> i got more money from bush 's tax cuts + stimulus than i will from obama 's $ 13 a week - and i 'm middle class . so i 'll take the republicans over the democrats , financially speaking .
NEG read the article idiot
NEG it 's a compromise . it minimizes the loss , does n't negate it . if the plan was to compensate mortgage companies to for the full amount that they would have made off of the shady loan , we 'd have to set up a few more printing presses to print all the money needed . <br> <br> from my understanding there are many banks & mortgage lenders who would like to renegotiate the terms but are not being allowed to by the holding company that backs up the loan . this program allows the bank or mortgage company to turn the loan completely over to fannie mae & freddie mac for the cost of $ 1,000 . the holding company is the big loser here , but they are the ones who established the rules that got is in this trouble in the first place .
NEG kerrigore is a liar .
POS and i thought my job was bad ! thanks for the refreshing info EMO_HAPPY
NEG deadpan stare .
NEG um , yeah ... were talking about the man behind the mormon gulag : <br>
NEG so does this mean , since i 'm a victim of drunk driving , and my legs are getting worse and worse by the day -LRB- the idiots got a slap on the hand -RRB- , that i can sue the fucking beer companies , for knowingly providing a substance that can kill/injure others ?
NEG some thought that blue ray was going to save the day cause it was better quality -LRB- audio and picture -RRB- but truth is that consumers really do n't care or know about quality but rather prefer convenience . take a look at the music industry . audio cd 's are much better quality than streaming or down loadable -LRB- mp3 files -RRB- still consumers are downloading or ripping songs from itunes and other online sites sacrificing audio quality for portability and on-demand needs . hollywood is not dead . the maker of electronic equipment are . what the people are asking for are tvs with direct online connection and great software interface to download , stream , play , watch , hear and browse anytime any media .
NEG what ? there is absolutely no effort underway anywhere to keep the lower classes from breeding . have you been to a walmart lately ?
NEG google holder 's involvement in the cover-up of the oklahoma city bombing and the related murder of kenneth trentadue . holder is an avowed gun grabber who has publicly stated he believes citizens have no right to own firearms . he is the very picture of a monster .
NEG when will israel allow inspections into its dimona nuke weapons plant ? that 's the only nation that regularly attacks and slaughters its neighbors in that region .
POS with the oil of aphrodite , and the dust of the grand wazoo , <br> you might not believe this little fella , but it 'll cure your asthma too .
NEG yeah , salt is just what i need when i 'm thirsty .
NEG matthew stafford is a poor man 's jamarcus russell . the lions will be terrible if they pick him 1 . take curry or monroe and try to work it out with stanton or culpepper .
NEG i am white and i do n't see attacks on white people . i see our society appropriately attacking racism where and when it exists . <br> <br> ` the democrat party on the other hand , talks down accomplishment , penalizes success and frowns upon independence . just look at the new administration and what is coming out of their mouths . ' <br> <br> oh , you mean a black man raised by a single mother and his grandparents who earned his way through school with hard work , excellent grades , working to help poor people while attending school . achieving more than anyone could have ever expected from a man born without family connections ? yeah , that 's not accomplishment .
NEG actually . . no . ot a valid defense . that is why major sites have lawyers . or you do n't sign .
NEG do n't assume that because you 're publishing the mayor 's email address that he 's going to get all praise . here 's my letter ... <br> <br> you 're getting a lot of publicity for your fox interview about not being ashamed to have great healthcare . but americans are increasingly aware that if you get healthcare at the expense of families like mine with no healthcare , you should be ashamed of yourself . if companies can provide great healthcare to their employees without going under , great . but if they have to get government involved , it becomes just plain theft through taxes , inflation and debt . <br> <br> sincerely , <br> <br> a concerned small business owner
NEG or you could just use the closest intersection , like bethel and king st , 96813 .
NEG it amazes me that content like this is locked to everyone but us users . <br> <br> when you make it this hard to access content legally , no wonder people resort to bittorent and bypass all this localization crap .
NEG oh geeze people -- i ca n't stand the psuedo-half science these hot air fantatics post . they mix cherry-picked datum with ad-hominem attacks to try to anger their opponents off of the debate . <br> <br> you and yours are pathetic , bombula . you know you do n't have any actual fact on your side and so you jump straight to the mud-slinging . please look up ` radiative forcing ' on someplace with a bit of actual credibility beyond wikipedia for posting -- you clearly have no idea how the phenomena works at all .
NEG not really stupid list
NEG again - you do n't quite understand how clinical depression works . <br> it 's not that he was unhappy that his pills were taken from him and decided to kill himself , no . his medication was helping to correct a chemical imbalance in his brain that was causing suicidal thoughts . <br> <br> you could say that because he was at a chemical imbalance that he was n't capable of making decisions ; that he was n't himself . if he were functioning normally -LRB- ie on his meds -RRB- then he would not have made this choice . he made an impared decision - and unlike alcohol he did not choose to be impared . <br> <br> so there . it is tragic that he is dead .
NEG fuck geoblocking !!!!!!!!!!!! <br> <br> edit : also ... riaa/mpaa and all the other proponents of stupid copyright and licencing bullshit on the internets !
NEG > only the market can provide a quality product at a lower price because it is run by people who are in search of a profit <br> <br> actually no . what actually happens is that people who are in search of a profit realise they are better of spending money on advertising , rather than improving the product . <br> <br> ` u.s. pharmaceutical industry spent 24.4 % of the sales dollar on promotion , versus 13.4 % for research and development '
NEG read more stories at check out on how to do it !
POS then in that case this looks like a good improvement ! especially as that hardware will go a lot further on osx than on windows , so it 's a nice little box .
NEG yes , but your dog and cat are domesticated creatures , not wild animals that happen to be three times as strong as a normal human .
NEG dc makes a great cage for monkeybusiness !! <br> it would seem like some kind of bad joke or dream ... wake up ? <br> <br> yes we can / f-it all up.x destroy a once great democratic republic . dem damn nwo republicrats !!
NEG ie has go to the worst web browser i 've ever used . slow , crash prone just blech . i remember first using firefox back when it was 0.7 firebird and back then it smoked ie i switched and never looked back have n't had any issues of compatibility at all for any website i 've visited . ie7 and ie8 are simply playing catch up to things browsers like opera and firefox have had for literally years now . i do n't think i could live without tabbed browsing and i just ca n't see it being worth while for anything other than windows security to even bother going past the stock ie7 install on my vista laptop as firefox was installed the first night i bought it and ie has never ever been used unless absolutely necessary
NEG rick was ok with rewarding all those morons standing around him with government money via the wall street bailout , was n't he ?
NEG all religions seem to be composed of a vast majority that just tries to get through life following a belief structure they find comforting , and of course all religions get knocked by everyone else because a somewhat statistically insignificant portion of their congregation are absolute douche bags who never seem to be more than 8 ' away from a camcorder .
POS that is fucking awesome .
NEG newcastle , uk
NEG too *
NEG so we now have a debate ... who is taking the bets !!!
NEG no wonder we are all so stressed out . information overload .
POS tubatechno : <br> <br> your conclusion is correct , no one in society has any moral authority . therefor no one should be given any opportunity to impose their morality on anyone else , and we should stick to democratic methods of making consensus rules based on morals shared by a plurality . <br> <br> so yes , we absolutely need to go down that road , and continue to follow it .
NEG you 're still trying to categorically lump in-vitro fertilization together with more noble pursuits such as fertility medications . <br> <br> i 'm talking specifically about in-vitro fertilization , not the more benign treatments like fertility drugs . <br> <br> you 're also making an emotional appeal in trying to draw a parallel between the physically disabled , and those who are deliberately determined to procreate at any cost . <br> <br> really , ld , i expected better than that of you .
POS heheh , capitalization courtesy of the shift key ! <br> <br> gaqua - you made me laugh , good to read comments from sensible people once in a while . <br>
NEG '' ` you have to wonder if month one is not a harbinger of things to come . '' ' <br> <br> i always knew what it was : socialism and the loss of the american way .
POS looking about i found some smashing deals . why am i just hearing about this now ?! <br> 2 for 1 hotel ? 2 for 1 rail ? # 1 trains fares ?? <br> is this real ?
NEG in case the squirrel comes in ? i 'd have a hard time trying to get the squirrel out , those lil buggers are devious .
NEG from the catechism of the catholic church section ii paragraph 2358 : <br> <br> ` the number of men and women who have deep-seated homosexual tendencies is not negligible . this inclination , which is objectively disordered , constitutes for most of them a trial . they must be accepted with respect , compassion , and sensitivity . every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided . these persons are called to fulfill god 's will in their lives and , if they are christians , to unite to the sacrifice of the lord 's cross the difficulties they may encounter from their condition . ' <br> <br> you are fully within your rights to disagree with the premise that homosexuality is ` objectively disordered ' -LRB- make sure you know what that means first though -RRB- , but you can not say that the church calls for torture or anything approaching that .
POS right on , docbob . it 's cool to see an obama supporter honest enough to admit they 're scratching their head right now , just as i will be more than glad to admit it if i 'm proven wrong about the guy . i honestly would love to vote democrat for my very first time in 2012 , because it will mean we had a good four years . <br> <br> but here i am , i 'm getting my taxes together and i 'm getting squeezed , i do n't even know how i 'm going to get the money together to pay what i owe because it 's been a tough year and all i can keep thinking of is , we have a tax cheat at the head of the irs . what the hell ??? <br> <br> is this change we can believe in ?
NEG @ musphaq - oh my god
NEG what ? i 'm being buried ? <br> <br> you people probably think the natives got smallpox because they had wussy immune systems , not because a foreign microorganism was introduced that they 've never been exposed to before and therefore had no immunity to . <br> <br> did you kids not get taught how vaccines work ?
NEG fucking horrible , that psycho deserves more then just acid in the eye 's .
NEG fuck kanye
NEG we figured out the auto-bury exists long ago after nothing from socialblade.com would ever hit the front page , several times the domain was submitted to digg and got over 300 diggs and never hit the front page .
NEG the only problem will be the accumulation of roaches . if you 've ever seen roaches that congregate in free standing coffee vending machines , you 'll know what i 'm talking about . on the other hand , that might mean additional protein . i 'm torn .
POS this picture adequately addresses my common requests to ` show me the money ' and ` show me the pussy . ' <br> <br> bravo .
POS funny thing is he is right about most things he talks about !
POS i think it is 10 different kinds of cool . i have been following shaq for weeks , and he is just awesome .
NEG any details on that dka ?
POS we should be ` all ' connected to the sea . great and rich talk , very inspiring .
POS i feel like i dream for hours ... an average dream is of 3 seconds is unbelievable .
NEG did you look into filing charges against the doctor ? if he is n't doing his job , i do n't think he deserves to be licensed .
NEG i really want you to grasp what i 'm trying to say here . i say you ` leach ' off of our healthcare because we 're the only group of people providing the constant breakthroughs in medical technology and treatments . if it were n't for our free market system advancing the system in leaps and bounds , we 'd all be using leaches to cure cancer still . i say you leach off of us because although you obviously have to buy the technology , that does n't help create anything new so you in fact contribute nothing to the system . and if you wo n't accept the widely known fact that the healthcare and quality of treatment for serious diseases is so much more superior in the usa than there 's no point in arguing any further . <br> <br> i said give me examples of government run programs that are n't bested by private sector counterparts . there are n't any . every single example of government run programs that actually have an equivalent private sector alternative always comes in behind that alternative . look at ups and fedex compared to the usps for example .
NEG firearm and ammunition manufacturers in the us are working major overtime to keep up with demand .
NEG 11 pages , seriously ?
POS i totally love this , but ... <br> <br> how the heck is this on the front page ? how many years old is this ? i was watching the dvd of this a few days ago , actually ... <br> <br> still awesome .
NEG there is considerable doubt as to whether or not an actual ` jesus ' ever existed . trying to save jesus from crucifixion would be like trying to save santa claus from crucifixion . face it - jesusneverexisted.com
NEG uhhh . . he 's not really a ` ex-brave ' although he played for the mets 2 years ago he did play for the braves last year ... so i 'd say , great we resign another brave .
POS once again , well said ron paul ! <br> <br> the government are very foolish not to listen to this guy !
NEG except for the fact that the first line in the article said that ` uhbama ' rejected this idea outright . it is individual states looking at it with interest now . <br> <br> you fail .
NEG become a drug dealer .

POS please digg for me friend ! i will always return the favor ...
NEG 25 reasons i hate facebook :
NEG i feel like i 'm missing something here .
NEG religion is for the hopeless , it gives them hope and that 's how it gets people in . thats why in catholic text it says the poor shall inherit the earth . it 's giving them hope for a good afterlife because this life sucks for the majority of poor people -LRB- working hard in lousy conditions for meager pay .
POS oh come on , back off junior , personally i think its time he became more aggressive on the track . nice guys finish last , lol !!! the rest of those drivers , and some of the fans , just sticking it to junior , because they 've been waiting , for the opportunity . simply put , because the fans love him and he is a nice guy , to nice sometimes for his own good ! so i for one , loved it ! bring it on !!!!!!!!!!!!
NEG more misleading software threatens users .
NEG why how very american of you .
NEG fuck the ifpa . -LRB- have to give equal time to the europeans . -RRB-
NEG just what the world needs , another nuclear arms race . thing is , what seems to be complicating matters is that so many countries can claim they are merely developing alternative energy sources because of the dwindling fossil fuel supply . but nuclear is so expensive , and potentially very dangerous -LRB- remember chernobyl and three mile island ? -RRB- . because of the efforts made by big oil over the past 30 years , solar power has never been seriously considered although it certainly deserves to be , along with wind technology . <br> <br> the most worrisome factor in this whole mess is the fear that is being deliberately spread by the media and by the government . we have to stop this war machine , and not just drink the noxious kool-aid being served up on this issue .
POS hahahahaha lol !
NEG @ darkshroud re : ' . . add in a low resource usage av like nod32 ' <br> <br> and that is why you fail . how about installing an os that does n't need an anti-virus product to work properly ?
NEG nice argument surfstang . should i be surprised ? no .
NEG yep ...
NEG <br> <br> he 's probably just a fanboy . in fanboy world , you ca n't talk about the opposing console at all .
NEG how 's life among the amish ? <br>
NEG i dunno if you are talking about obama or osama . i was just playing the fool ayway . note the 711 .
NEG hell no . i tried linux for about a year and now it was pretty cool but i 'm happily using vista now . try running photoshop or ableton live on ubuntu and let me know how that works for you . you ca n't do shit on linux except play first person shooters and check your email .
POS ooh ! shiny ! EMO_HAPPY
NEG actually , people will buy a car from a company in bankruptcy protection if the government or 3rd party issues a guarantee . people will not buy a car from a company that has a very high probability of filing for bankruptcy the next month . because then their warranty is at risk of being wiped by the bankruptcy filing . i 'd rather have the government spend money issuing a guarantee on the cars and then chapter 11 . it is a lot cheaper than fueling all the existing legacy costs .
NEG reversing records and tapes went out of fashion long ago . it 's just mumbo jumbo . this is a childish suggestion and post at the very least . rivals the ` fema death camp ' crap
NEG why so few in the ivy league ?
NEG how about god damned jimmy kimmel ? how is that man employed ? he 's just not funny !
NEG yeah sure , keep drinking the kool-aid
NEG that is a misconception . low attention span is attributed to high intelligence . <br>
NEG am i missing something here ? <br>
NEG the fags were really necessary .
NEG so far he is going about this in the entirely wrong way . throwing away nearly a trillion dollars is no way to start .
POS the thing is , this is great news . our climate is healthier than we thought . leftists , however , will be quite depressed at the news .
NEG full of old people .
NEG now i really feel bad for the thousands of people they recently laid off
NEG then let this news be for her parents , not the whole world .
NEG expensive batteries killed the electric car - not gm . <br> <br> by the way , gm is n't the only company to attempt to build a feasible electric car .
NEG tasteless is as tasteless admires , captain tasteless .

NEG there 's a reason that network is locked , digg .
NEG this story makes me happy and sad at the same time ... <br> <br> <br> ... fuck cancer
POS most touching thing i 've seen in a long time . for children diagnosed with a terminal illness , i 'm sure this lends a much-needed feeling of permanence to their lives .
POS interesting quote miknarf ... i like it
NEG i ca n't help but to laugh . cops use them on anyone ranging from children to elderly people and it 's not a big deal . a cop shoots himself and he goes to the hospital for his wounds and its newsworthy . <br> hah . double standard ? never .
NEG so are macbooks only for the rich ? do you really think it 's a status symbol and that you 're any cooler than us leet pc people ? <br> <br> think again , moron . <br> <br> do n't try to use your macbook as a basis for acting snoobish , noob . grow a pair of balls and get a life .
NEG certificate chains can be > 3
NEG man ... again with the same weed stories on the fp . the potheads have taken over digg . no wonder the site is kinda slow most of the time .
NEG whoosh !
NEG no worries , just log on to your neighbors wifi with a spoofed mac to do illegal things online . when your done , delete the spoofed mac . even if the cops check the log they cant trace the mac back to you assuming you do n't go to any sites that require you to logon .
NEG some of the links above mention that it 's in a reservoir . <br> -LRB- first link in the first comment of the thread by vroom101 -RRB-

NEG but keep calling calling calling ok
NEG he is correct about the vicious cycle that ends up , by design i will add , only marginalizing people . these types of systems and ` society ' as whole can not last for very long .
POS great quote from notting hill . patrick norton posted the post from one of the guys on twitter . i should have submitted to digg .

NEG well , i guess nothings changed there .
POS woot woot i wan na see brad pitt again !!! <br> <br> i love you brad !!!! <br> <br> > 333 <br> :-RRB-
NEG i think i 'd feel like i 'd won double-time if i beat someone in-game and caused them to get mad enough to have to pay to software to kick me off the xbox for a few hours . . <br> <br> not like i ca n't go watch a movie , play another console , play single player , go outside , read a book , go out with friends , or more . .
NEG i need your help keeping this link alive , those that fought and died for our country are being forgotten by those that started the war . please please please help me by giving names of those loved ones that you know of that died in iraq and afganistan . <br> thank you !

NEG the i stands of its a ds idiot , same thing we 've been selling for years , but now with a sh * tty camera . enjoy wasting your money again .
NEG i did , thank god america did n't choose a racist greedy old neo-confederate .
NEG i doubt there will be another strike . the basis for the original strike was a provision in writer 's contracts for royalties gained by digital distribution , including dvd sales percentages -LRB- which they found to be too low and were an antiquated measurement based on antiquated production costs of vhs tapes -RRB- as well as internet streaming and other distribution channels . <br> <br> writers were the main cause of the strike since a great deal of their money seems to come from royalties . larry david addressed this briefly in a curb your enthusiasm episode where someone asks him about seinfeld . <br> writers_guild_of for more information .
NEG this was on an episode of ` all in the family ' where archie complains to mike that he put the toilet paper on backwards . so now in some weird subconscious way every time i wipe my butt i think of archie bunker .
NEG imho : a huge part of the equation of the housing market crash that everyone seems to be ignoring is that the builders ` all ' seem to be building these ` mcmansions ' that 95 % of the people ca n't really afford .
POS this is on of the fatest growing engineering editorial site . tekhpoynt.com is here is to help engineering <br> aficionado .
NEG 5 nominees for best actor ... <br> <br> 1 pit with razor sharp spikes & tigers ... <br> <br> chuck em in the pit & make em fight for the prize . <br> <br> whomever gets out of the pit surely deserves to be hailed as ` best actor ' .
NEG this is stupid as shit . who cares that someone can play a song on a virtual keyboard , not to mention , probably the most basic shit out there next to marry had a little lamb . if he busted out some mozart or beethoven i 'd give him props , but this is nothing impressive . buried .
NEG snakes are not like dogs . as long as they keep the snake fed , all should be right . however , the first time that snake is hungry and the parents are out running errands . oh boy . in the belly of a snake , that is .
NEG going to the original composite photo , i think it would have worked better if they had made a 2d array of the undistorted photos rather than squeezing them horizontally for the article . the images , or at least some of them , would have still looked ` vase-like ' .
NEG <br> <br> market adjustments to home prices is fine and works for just about every commodity out there . complete crashing , like what we 've seen in detroit , is not a good thing and i do n't mind the government working to make that not happen . i know two people who foolishly got adjustable rate mortgages and now ca n't afford them at their higher rates . numbers would obviously have to be run , but to me it makes more sense to readjust these people 's mortgages to fixed rate than to have people , who could pay a lower fixed rate , default on their loans . for those who simply bit off more than they could chew -LRB- e.g. making $ 50k a year , yet got a $ 500k loan -RRB- , let them sink or swim on their own .
NEG fl is stupid , why the fuck do we live here !!!???
POS only a billion ? why do i feel that 's a low estimate ? subsidies for growing farms aside , i still think it would easily surpass $ 1 billion . even so , this is great news , and am glad that california can take this step in bringing attention to one simple fact : marijuana is virtually harmless .
POS and yet another reason to use foxit reader .
NEG sweet beard
NEG i think you mention for people to get ready for katrina squared -LRB- that 's katrina ^ 2 or ` katrina times katrina ' -RRB- . but i say it might be katrina plex -LRB- that 's katrina ^ katrina or ` katrina times katrina katrina times ' -RRB- .
NEG reality comes crashing home sooner than you think . in 2 months this will have a new story - for now , still laid off , and desperately need work 10 levels below my last paygrade , please please please get me a job with mcdonalds etc. <br> <br> that story however wo n't make news .

NEG oh man , that 's bad .
NEG and what the fuck is thet 150lbs go to do without at least a 5gw power source ? <br> <br> its not like you can shove a fusion reactor up his ass .
NEG whether you like file sharing or not , this is the begining of full internet regulation . <br> <br> on internet 2 , you do n't have a website , the isps let you rent a page on theirs , as long as you behave .
POS you betcha !
NEG ridiculous review ! while reviewer acknowledges the worst parts -LRB- namely kids being blinded and maimed and then forced to beg -RRB- it then connects the movie to some obscure social issue of the moment in indian society . i know that street kid can not win a millionaire game show , just like i know that forest gump can not be a successful athlete , businessman and a war hero . it 's just a movie for god 's sake
NEG unfortunately the ego of us indians is bigger than our desire to fix our s @ t. this hoopla by some indians is because they do n't want their dirty laundry displayed in public . i 've driven through these slums in mumbai and i can assure you they are incredibly miserable enough to make a grown man cry . there is nothing desirable , artsy , cultural , or eclectic about them . <br> <br> / indian
POS haha nice
NEG if the news industry receives a bailout and is beholden to the government , then it is n't a news anymore . the power of the purse concept it exactly why the founding fathers did not allow government to tax newspapers . if they can not adapt , they have to die . i do n't want them too , but this country has to stop practicing reverse darwinism -- the practice of sparing the weak by killing the strong .
NEG you 're giving away my rib recipe !
NEG now is the best time to get this bill through ... cali struggling with the $ $ $
NEG i think the address range of ipv4 is the least of our problems . that can be solved by moving to ipv6 . <br> the bigger problem is going to be domain name lookup -LRB- dns -RRB- and having a human readable name for all those addresses . already the word-like combinations for domains are pretty much exhausted and strange words appear -LRB- eg . digg.com -RRB- . <br> assume every device has a unique ipv6 address on the internet . how are you going to remember the address of your home computer for example . it will be something like 2df8 :3 ebc :7 c6a : b82c :6 eb3 :276 d :75 a4 :3 d2c when most people are lucky to remember their home phone number . mypc.streetaddress.mytown.com would be memorable and unique , but who wants to give away that information on the net . <br> dns is global , so lookups based on ` unique ' factors like your name wo n't work . there 's most likely a thousand other who shares the same name as you . the internet is going to need a better directory service ! <br> <br>
NEG i believe i discovered this after failing a midterm due to facebook distraction last year .
NEG ` hey ! you big meanie !! '
NEG i have n't read the f ` ing article but that 's probably why it was raffled instead of sold . oh the taxes are going to kill them . and in maine if you own a home for less than two years and sell it , the state takes a hefty sum in taxes .

NEG credit card companies need to get away from the static number system and either implement a electronic hardware one time password system or a non electronic passwindow one time password system . it undermines the biggest payment method funding the net .

NEG honestly the colts do n't need him . manning can probably throw the ball to anyone . besides gonzalez and wayne , do n't forget the colts have dallas clark , who caught some ridiculous passes in traffic this season . <br> <br> what the colts really need is to sign an every-down running back , addai/rhodes just has n't been cutting it this season and if they can establish their running game , manning and his receivers would have a much easier time moving down the field with their passing game ; easier than having another solid receiver ironically .
NEG vegas sucks . all the strippers have kids and are on meth . jobs dont pay shit . its hot as hell . nothing to do except gamble , catch stds from the strippers who live next door or go boating on lake mead which is about to dry up . <br> <br> seriously , i moved to vegas a few years back because of the lower cost of living . i moved in december and had to move back to los angeles by june . think about that , vegas was so crazy , the people so fucked up that i had to move to los angeles to be around normal people again ! <br> <br> vegas is nothing but a pipe dream . she will always leave you broke and wanting to go back to where you came from .

NEG the dollar is not in the equation . i realize that dollars/pounds/yen are just pieces of paper whose values can be bubbles or -LRB- like the american dollar probably soon will -RRB- rapidly devalue . <br> <br> gold/silver are like currency in many ways though . they do have the advantage that , since it is difficult to print gold the market is n't likely to get flooded with gold - but many minerals and stones share this characteristic.what makes gold so special ? it 's all in our heads - just like every other bubble . <br> <br> land is even more difficult to print than gold . it grows more scarce with increases in population . houses often come with land and represent a significant amount of labor . if one owns a home with a value of ` x ' they will enjoy far more benifits than a person who owns a sum of gold with an equal value . the housing bubble was dumb but not as dumb as the gold bubble . <br> <br> i 'm not saying buying gold is necessarily stupid - you can get very rich off of bubbles as many did with housing - just be aware that they pop . <br> <br> also wealth is destroyed . depreciation , vandalism , consumption -LRB- eg . food -RRB- , and reduction in number of services provided all destroy wealth . i believe what you are getting at is that wealth does n't instantly evaporate unless icbms are launched . it is important to be aware that these factors do erase wealth because as a recession or depression wears on they will force some gold owners to cash in their investment to replace other assets . this will cause gold to start consistently losing value . this will cause a loss of confidence in the bubble - then it will pop .

NEG it sounds like in ms krause 's case they wo n't make any money . maybe they thought it would be a big bust and worth the money . i dunno . <br> <br> in a drug bust , the property of the one busted , or unclaimed property found at the site , or even the land itself , can be forfeit . it depends on a million things , but the basics are if there 's a criminal conviction in drugs , then it opens up the money game . this may only be with felonies , which may go toward ms. krause 's words about the sheriff expecting 500 plants instead of her 24 . <br> <br> anyway , assuming many things : <br> * bust somebody and later there 's a conviction <br> * the county then sues the -LRB- new -RRB- felon in civil court using the criminal conviction as evidence <br> * based on that evidence , the county gets the land , the car found there , etc. <br> <br> it 's very big money . while drug cases have special provisions to make it easier for the government to get the goods , it can also apply to other crimes . such as if somebody robs a bank , the county can sue to get the car that was used in the crime . otherwise , the car would -LRB- should -RRB- be returned after the case is over , even if the person is convicted . <br> <br> for drug cases , many times law enforcement is able to find a boatload of cash . not for ms krause 's 24 plants , but if they find a briefcase full of money , the county sues , gets the cash , and then they buy more ambulances , firetrucks , police cars , oak desks for the city counsel , etc. <br>

NEG why would you want to compile a program on a phone ? the developer cross-compiles it on his computer and distributes a binary . since it will be an uniform software platform , there will be no need to compile locally in any way . this has worked for ages on ce devices such as the gp2x , nokia 770/n800/n810 , pandora , android , limo phones , etc. <br> <br> just because you can compile if you want does n't mean you have to . case in point : you can compile firefox on your windows pc . how many people actually do that ?

NEG see fungie5 's response for some of the reason they do n't do this . basically the shuttle parachute works because it only has to safely slow the plane from a pretty slow speed that is just above the minimum speed the shuttle can ` fly ' at . it only has to work in one orientation to the horizon -LRB- horizontal nose forward -RRB- . and the shuttle frame is built like a mac truck compared to an airplane that is built like a bird . there is only one place the frame of an airplane could possibly withstand the forces generated by a parachute deployment , and that is at the root of the wings on the spar . not an ideal placement for a parachute .

NEG it 's one thing to copy minor or common features not available for macintosh browsers . i 'm fine with that . <br> <br> the problem is when apple rips off a feature and pretends they are the ones who thought of it in the first place . on the feature list , they claim they are the first browser to pass acid3 compliance . no , they are using the webkit engine which passed on the same day that opera 's engine passed as well . they say they are the first browser able to integrate with rss feeds . actually , opera and firefox both have been utilizing rss technology long before safari implemented that feature . <br> <br> those are only several examples of their hubris but there 's about a dozen more of these white lies spread throughout their marketing . i 'm ok with feature copying as a form of flattery , but apple has a bad habit of misrepresenting the facts to make it look like they were the innnovators when in actuality they are just pissing on the shoulders of giants .

NEG what part does n't make sense ? i do have some microbiology classes under my belt do you ? <br> <br> bacteria of all sorts are not good for you in certain doses . good bacteria can run a muck and cause disease too . we call them good bacteria because they are naturally part of the fauna of our bodies and in normal numbers they contributes to our health . when their numbers are too great they cause disease . whole milk spoils as well . <br> <br> outside of the environment they are acclimatized to -LRB- adapted to -RRB- the bovine body those bacteria will likely not do as well giving room for other bacteria to grow . many bacteria will be introduced at all levels of industrial handling and if those bacteria grow faster than the natural bovine fauna then you get dangerous whole milk . part of the reason why pasteurization was mandated int he first place was the rampant cases of food poisoning due to bacteria introduced into the milk and which did better than the ones already in the milk . <br> <br> think of yeast infections . yeast is a natural part of the fauna of human female genitalia but when there is a sudden shift in numbers or a ph shift which kills the yeast you can get an infection of either an over abundance of natural yeast or different strains of yeast . <br> <br>

NEG the thing you have left out of your analysis is the criminal behavior being engaged in by hedge funds . they have worked in cahoots with the analyst firms and even financial journalists to destroy public companies for gain . since the removal of the uptick rule in 2007 , short sellers have run rampant in the market . they took down a perfectly healthy bear stearns in a couple of days , for example , which would have been impossible with the uptick rule in place . you may think this is a conspiracy article , but it was written by a former treasury secretary : <br> <br> personally i 'm getting out of the stock market completely until they reinstate this rule .

POS ` congress needs to craft innovative legislation that makes health care more affordable without raising taxes or increasing the deficit . it also needs to repeal bad laws that keep health care costs higher than necessary . ' ` we should remember that hmos did not arise because of free-market demand , but rather because of government mandates . the hmo act of 1973 requires all but the smallest employers to offer their employees hmo coverage , and the tax code allows businesses -- but not individuals -- to deduct the cost of health insurance premiums . the result is the illogical coupling of employment and health insurance , which often leaves the unemployed without needed catastrophic coverage . ' ` while many in congress are happy to criticize hmos today , the public never hears how the present system was imposed upon the american people by federal law . as usual , government intervention in the private market failed to deliver the promised benefits and caused unintended consequences , but congress never blames itself for the problems created by bad laws . instead , we are told more government -- in the form of `` universal coverage '' -- is the answer . but government already is involved in roughly two-thirds of all health care spending , through medicare , medicaid , and other programs . ' ` the following are bills congress should pass to reduce health care costs and leave more money in the pockets of families : '

NEG ok , ok - i get the idea . looking at the source for the page is easiest . does anyone else find watching paint dry -LRB- or discussions about html , come to that -RRB- more interesting than motor sports ?
POS hillyi take your earlier point buti would like to support any new runners that take up the flm challenge . in june 2001 i had a kidney removed following 4 years of serious illness . i had never ran races before but 8 months later i completed the 2002 flm in 5 hours , not fast i know , but i did not find it that hard-really !! and i enjoyed every minute and raised 2000 pounds for charity . i have a golden bond again to do it this year . providing you put in sensible training , and respect the distance , i really believe anyone can do it , good luck to everyone
NEG my body seems to be telling me to take it easy this week too . not sure why , this has n't happened before but this week i 've been spectactularly exhasted for no apparent reason . . i have been out 4 times already but normally can cope with that . wanting to up my training a bit and was planning to go out this afternoon . do n't know what to do now ! i 'm not injured , just sleepy ! should i go ?!
NEU did not . im a speed reader -LRB- unlike my running -RRB- . marvellous quote tho , wonder if the ward will have any spare daily mails . i could make a scrapbook of the trials and tribulations
NEU i ran reading half yesterday and was really pleased with my time and thought generally it was well organised , however what did disappoint me -LRB- aside from teh 45 min delay -RRB- was the number of slower runners that started at the front despite there being markers to indicate times . i have to admit that i was in the box ahead of where i should have been but one comment i heard was ` ooh it says sub - 1:20 , perhaps we should move back ' . the reply was ` no it will take us ages to cross the line ' . i finished in 1.29 officially but it still took me 1 1/2 minutes to cross the line so my actual time was 1:27 , and for the entire race i continually overtook people . i was glad i didnt start further back with the sub 1.30 where i should have been . but if it had been managed properly , then you wouldnt get people trying to start in a higher ability group and slow down those behind them who are in the correct group .
POS hi taz , . i hope the new physio instills more confidence in you . it can be an expensive trial trying to find one you feel happy with , and who is effective and i am eternally grateful to my colleague who recommended her . i ca n't believe how different i feel about it all now , as to last week . i have n't run yet - next run is tomorrow , but shall carry on spending as much time as i can with my legs up to prevent further problems . believe me , i am so impressed with the results and feel confident that things will come right in the end . but , i am going to be super dooper careful from here on in . i hope you get some good news , or at least feel happy with what is diagnosed tonight . let us know how you get on .
NEU hmmm ... 4:14:45 for me . how about a competition to see who gets a time closest to their race number ? like 2:31:42 for number 23142 ?
POS we enjoyed supporting !!! ca n't blooming speak now tho EMO_HAPPY
POS i noticed the st john 's people around the route of course but did n't quite appreciate the scale of the turnout until i went into the tent at the end for some ice on my ankle . i did n't realise there were so many of them in the country let alone london ! well done and thanks .
NEU quite a few people mentioned that the chip times -LRB- as published on the website -RRB- are showing their time to be exactly 3 seconds faster than the one from their own watch -LRB- this includes me -RRB- . . anybody got a expalanation/theory for this ?
NEG malt , i used last year 's schedule , but for the prague marathon , and this year 's schedule for flm . both times i followed them to the letter , and both times had really bad runs . i did prague in 4:09 and flm in 4:16 , but under easier conditions . previously i had never done a marathon in more than 4 hours , and had never thought i would . i do n't know if it 's the schedules , or if i am just getting too old , or what the problem is . but , i 'm a sucker for someone else telling me what to do and will probably follow next year 's schedule as well , whatever it turns out to be .
POS ah ha - a new number to play trick phone calls on ! now i can leave legless , saqib and eddie alone ... . has anyone else been getting legless ' sick jokes via text message ??? they are making me laugh though :--RRB- . humpless , 4.30 ???????? i do n't finish until 6.30 and can meet at liverpool st station at about 6.40 if you want . otherwise i can meet you there around 7 .
NEU spans . oakley 20 is probably best described as ` undulating ' rather than ` hilly ' . i seem to remember one fairly sharp incline on loop 1 -LRB- 12 miles -RRB- at about 3 or 4 miles . loop 2 -LRB- 8 miles -RRB- did n't include it .
NEU dare we hope then ?
NEU getting better ... 9 -LRB- ish -RRB- in 1.24 - even included some hills -LRB- definitely not grade a fell ! -RRB- .
NEU cardiac risk in the young . need to raise 1250 . looking to get at least 1500
NEU i 'm loosely following a rw sub 3 programme , but anti social work schedule means that i have to do the long runs and speed sessions on different days to the programme . now up to 65 miles per week . i 'm about 10 miles per week up on last years schedule which resulted in flm 2003 , 3.00.42 . so i 'm fairly upbeat about it all .
POS thanks jj . out for a 15m run myself tomorrow . will be my longest run yet . i ran 14m last weekend and 12m the weekend before . m = miles not metres !! hope you have a good run and your knee holds out . foz
POS figs are definitely what you do want before a big race . but make sure you leave plenty of time twixt breakfast and `` last chance '' .
POS excellant job meerkat ... will be hanging on the rw 11min pacer for dear life in the hope of reaching you all at mile 18 to be rewarded with jbs from meerkat and jj ! thank you in advance incase i am incoherant by then ! hiya sutts ... ready ?
NEU official time , as per the one they officially give you on the results list , is chip time . ... although last year they forgot , and put up the gun time for a few hours , then realised their error and changed it to chip time
POS good luck to everyone although luck wo n't come into it . not even bad luck !!!!! smile for the finish camera
POS brilliant day , even though i hate running in the rain , but the crowd support was excellent . ended up 90mins slower than i wanted -LRB- wanted a 4h , finished in 5h30 -RRB- , but i forgive myself that with a lack of training and that rain as my excuse . pb - was ian duncan smith running when you saw him , because the only time i saw him was at the blue start -LRB- surely he should have been at green -RRB- , wearing a suit and shoes . looked to me like he was dropping out . the urwfrc point at mudchute was great , even though i nearly missed it . -LRB- how could flora put a water station there , of all places . -RRB- . the only `` celeb '' i saw running was -LRB- the back of -RRB- bobby charlton in front of me at about mile23 . i 'm hoping i beat him , but probably did n't . anyway , well done to you all .
NEU first marathon , trained for 3.28 . started in middle of pen 5 , got 3.34 chip time . felt no probs at start , but 1st 2 miles were v frustrating ; lots of stopping and starting due to bunching . so many people just changing course made things difficult , the few that gave hand signals -LRB- not that sort of hand signal !!! -RRB- made it easier . great day , great support , feel that i want to try and get that 3.28 before i get much older
POS thanks for the welcome everyone -LRB- you are a friendly bunch are n't you :--RRB- -RRB- . taking a rest today , have my last 22 miler planned for tommorrow , eek , before starting taper for blackpool . mmm ... looking forward already to lazy saturday mornings after 20 june !! sarah , peter , i 'm planning my first tri this year - london tri in july -LRB- just the baby sprint tri -RRB- . before the end of last year i could hardly swim 2 lengths without having to stop . now i 'm doing 50 lengths twice a week . not the speediest fish in the pool -LRB- so to speak -RRB- but much more comfortable with it . the thought of an open water swim in a wetsuit is a bit scary though . i 've also got a new , speedy almost-road-bike -LRB- a bit of a hybrid -RRB- with skinny tyres which is a revelation after years using my heavy ` granny ' bike . it makes cycling fun ! anyway , good training -LRB- and a nice bank holiday weekend -RRB- to everyone . tm
NEU i 've just got the watch -LRB- i did n't bequeath for my first two -RRB- . b.t.w. haver they started sending out the newsletter yet ?
POS oooh i see blackmail is rife !! nobody would want my food anyway so i am safe ;--RRB- . i like the no food for non runners but as imelds is bringing the glitzy stuff maybe an exception to the rule !! poppy plans her list . 5 sets of kit . 5 pairs socks . 2 trainers . gps . logbook . notebook . pens . 5 bras for training . lucazade sport . mobile-you never know . change for phone ;--RRB- . rain jacket . gloves x2 . buff . glitzy gear . casual gear . showerstuff . towells . pj 's . underwear . shorts . thats all i can think of for now ;--RRB- .
POS done my domestic duty and just about to go for a 10 mile run . . hilly - i think i enjoy the training more than the actual racing . it is nice to get away from it all , go off-road for a few hours and switch off completely . 25 miles tomorrow with some others from the club , almost all off-road followed by podretta 's 7th birthday party -LRB- olympics party at the leisure centre -RRB- . lots of carbs in jelly and ice cream !
NEU morning a-man 69 . dare i ask why your called that ?
NEG rf-sounds like you should change your name to elastiman . i ca n't touch my toes with straight legs ! podiatrist 's verdict yesterday-inflammed sesamoid bones and ligaments that run under ball of left foot . need to take it easy regarding running . might mean i 'll have to defer flm to 2006 :-LRB-
POS ooops , wc , well done to you too . i 've just been reading that the sussex half was not a certified course and appears to be short , so i think i may have made the right decision .
NEG quite nice been injured . just done a slow 4 miles round the block then came back for lots of stretching and ice . more massage booked tomorrow and am dreading it cause legs are sore from small amount of massage on friday !! hope everyone does well today , i 'm looking forward to reading all about it tonight . :--RRB- .
NEU felt really pleased with a swift -LRB- well for me all things are relative -RRB- 13 miles in 1.35 this morning and then i read the tragic news of the worthing 20 runner - all seems pretty insignificant somehow after that news . worked from home today -LRB- honest do you want to see the evidence ! -RRB- as daughter has piano exam this pm . then its time for a quick swim , some pasta and then go watch the corporate challenge in chichester tonight , 4000 metres in two speed categories . there 's speed work and then there 's speed work . good to cheer my fellow club members looking like ... robw - listen to dunnarunner , he 's right - do n't do the long run if there is doubt that you can really do it without making any injury worse - there is not enough time now to recover from anything remotely serious . ` expo thursday runners who lunch club members ' ! looking forward to it . take care all . pr
POS -LRB- stops lurking -RRB- . hi all - . hope you do n't mind me joining in at this late stage - i 've spent the last few weeks having a dilemma about what my target time is so which forum to join ! it 's my first marathon , longest run was a 21 miler last week , 3:30 - so i 'm hoping for sub 4:30 , allowing for the unknown of the last few miles . . it has been really good to read everyone 's ups and downs on the forum - this week is definitely `` feeling overtrained '' week , hoping the various niggles settle down during the taper . hope everyone enjoys the shorter long runs tomorrow - i 'm doing 13 miles -LRB- along the thames , boat race course there and back -RRB- . great not to be running in the ice and cold any more ! jezza
POS well peeps . . the barriers have appeared and are starting to go up around evelyn street , lower road and surrey quays . banners are now hanging above the chav 's arms -LRB- also known as the surrey docks pub -RRB- proclaiming ` watch the london marathon here ' . looks like we got us a race , goin ' on ! wp - no need to ruin your kit . just write your name on paper with a thick permanent marker , do a quick diy-laminating job using some sellotape , et voila ! br - the name thing really does work ! back in 2002 i ran the nyc marathon and tried it for the first time . . would never run without it again . in fact , i 'll be running wearing exactly the same big of paper bearing my name that ran with in nyc , paris , dublin and rotterdam . it 's looking a wee bit battered now , but . . call me superstitious . just need to find some way of fitting ` tea & toastman ' on their too . need a bigger chest , methinks . : -0
POS do n't stop me now , . i 'm having such a good time , . i 'm having a ball . do n't stop me now , . you wan na have a good time . just give me a call . and do n't stop me now ... hippo , for some reason i did n't think you had a h ***** d , you always sound so centred and together and -LRB- another word i ca n't think of -RRB- . have a good evening to make up for it . probably signing off , need to put kids to bed and pack , will try not to come here in the morning or i 'll never catch the train . good luck to all still here , thanks for all the advice/support/laughs , maybe see diana d , delia and hippo and others at expo and/or bandstand - i really hope so ! remember we are supposed to be doing this of our own free will - so let 's enjoy it , esp those of us doing it once only -LRB- yes , really ! -RRB-
POS last post before the flm . good luck everyone , but most of all have fun
POS i 'm glad i was n't the only person wondering about this -LRB- i 'm not so sick after all ... hoorah ! -RRB-
POS can i be a supporter next year ? i think it 's just fab what you lot did and especially you meerkat for organising it all -LRB- sorry for lack of punctuation -RRB- .
POS hummm i think i might have that shirl !!! where is the q !! not sure about tomorrow , will let you know as soon as poss .
POS lucinda - go get 'em tomorrow !!! natalie - go get 'em ... er ... tonight - i will be too ! . rick . . oh rick ... here boy ! * waves nice full glass of red enticingly *
NEU i have n't really thought about it yet , i 'm going to do a last minute.com type approach i think . i could push the wife into getting promoted and become a house husband , not !! quality control for a vineyard would be nice , as long as it 's red only .
POS shades , . yes i have my international certificate of competence for motor yachts so can now charter and skipper a boat anywhere in the world . perhaps we should have a sub 5 holiday cruising the med or the caribbean ??! delia , . i was n't a golden bond runner but have n't got my marathon pics yet , i believe they take quite a long time .
POS no surprise there then hey rick !!!
POS jane m. thanks , that 's true i did n't learn till i went to the big school hee hee . anyway , attention should all be going to superdebbo and not to grump ol me .
NEU sarah have n't said well done on your 16 miler - fantastic ! euph coastal path sounds very dodgy & dangerous . scarey . good luck on sunday . freemers i live in a village on the bury side of thetford . 4/9 i am planning to do fram 10k which was a hilly 2 lap course but has changed this year for health & safety reasons . prob now a very hilly 2 lap course!i joined the thread before flm 2004 & did n't enter 2005 but have followed the thread anyway . do you do xc ?
NEG i did about 4ish miles very easy - probably close to 9 or 10 mins and i couldnt have gone ay faster . my other half who didnt seem to suffer as much as i did was complaining about the pace so i must have been going slow . however i fell over at the end of my run and landed on my hands and face -LRB- dont ask -RRB- - knees escaped ! - tripped over a pavement and having been discharged from physio yesterday , i now have a very sore si joint today so wondering if i gone backwards again so i am having a bit of a panic .
NEU katie , what a nightmare - well done for picking yourself up and your pb ! champagne - i 've printed off a split time thing off nikerunning.com , specifically for new york , allowing for all the ups and downs - first mile - 8:46 , 2nd mile 7:29 . its absolutely wicked . i 'll try and stick to it for as long as i can !! . as i have had no build up races as preparation - except a 10k which i pb 'd at 42:48 a couple of weeks ago , i 'm not sure of my level at present . ooops caps lock !!
NEG hello all , . happy new year all , especially trouty and karen . i am glad i came back to the uk for christmas , with temperatures reaching 44-46 degrees in sydney yesterday and poor air quality because of the bush fires it does not seem to be very pleasant there at the moment . even though i have found it cold i managed 85 miles last week , my highest for many months . i have found that my heart rate monitor does not register properly when it is cold . normally it is ok after about 10-15 mins , i.e. when i start sweating but this morning i did not get a proper reading for all of my 1 hr run . does anybody else have this problem ?
POS wow , so mnay newbies ! welcome everyone . well today was my first real flm training run and i did 5 miles steady with a faster mile in the middle . i fantacised about a large malt whisky and chocolate for most of the time -LRB- as i 'm abstaining -RRB- which took my mind off the hills ;--RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- . re speed training - i prefer to do mine on the treddy because then i ca n't cheat and pretend i 've run further than i have ! for hill training i only ahve to go out of the door as i ca n't avoid the blessed things where i live !
POS one for beav and jonah8 . a man walks into a bar with a dachshund under his arm . the dog is wearing a man city shirt , bobble hat and scarf . the barman says , `` hey ! no pets allowed in here ! you 'll have to leave ! '' the man begs , `` look , i 'm desperate . we 're both big fans , my tv is broken , and this is the only place we can see the game against united . '' after securing a promise that the dog will behave and warning that if there is any trouble they will be thrown out , the barman relents and allows them to stay in the bar and watch the game . . city attack from the kick off and their first goal attempt is cleared off the line for a corner . with that the dog jumps up on the bar and begins walking up and down the bar giving everyone a high-five . the barman says , `` wow that is the most amazing thing i 've ever seen ! what does the dog do if they score a goal ? '' `` i do n't know , '' replies the owner , `` i 've only had him for four years . '' !!!!
POS glasgow / florida . . same thing ! hi depth charge , so how long was it to the start line then ?
POS well deserved zzzzs , ws ! managed to zip between the rain storms to do 8 miles of recovery running this evening . not too wet . it 's very mild out in sw17 again - had to take off the hat and gloves and really did n't need to bother with the second top layer . must be the insulating effect of the pollution round the tooting area !
NEU nobody has asked if i am gay - tee hee ? gingerbreadman , are you coming out of the closet with all your ` gay ' questions , do you live in a village ? ginger is a popular name in the club i go to .
POS ashley smith . you should definitely do a marathon to celebrate 40 = i did dublin in oct 05 following my big birthday in sept. i even got a 1/2 on the day of my birthday - i know its sad but as a runner you will understand ! i cannt beleive there are people out there who will support me ! i am flying from belfast on my own and wont have any supporters myself so would really appreciate a cheer !
NEG shades - i take a bottleof water with me , but normally i do n't finish it . i finish the bottle on my way home , when the run is over . i drink because my mouth gets dry and because i know i have to .
POS blousey , i think i got wrong end of stick . i thought you were running whilst out there ! whatever you do , have a blinkin good time EMO_HAPPY
POS congratulations , tillyp !! well done nikster ! -LRB- got ta get out running again soon -RRB-
NEU and then there 's me panicing about only running 70 in my cut-back week . that 's more than i ran in the whole of 2004 ! what have i become ?! anyway , where 's that sun cream ...
NEG ouch pw that is sore !! mine is nearly recovered now but it was only overstretched i think not torn . luckily your martial arts training will help you block out some of the pain . just hope you dont do any more damage though !! glad you are able to do some training though .
NEG i like pearce 's post match comments : . `` to say i am disappointed would be one of the biggest understatements of all time , '' . `` if i was a supporter , i would be disgusted with that performance . i know i am as a manager . we showed no moral courage whatsoever . `` i do not include the goalkeeper in this , but the rest of them i have told to go home , have a look at their kids and ask them how daddy did today . `` none of them stepped up to the plate . none of them showed any leadership . none of them earned their wages . without doubt , it was the worst experience i have had as a manager . `` i have been in bad teams during my career but i would like to think somewhere down the line , if i was n't playing well , i had the bottle to receive the ball . `` i had the bottle to get in someone 's face and i had the bottle to get aggressive with someone , show my aggression out on the pitch and show i was not happy . `` our players did not do that today . i am not passing the responsibility onto the players . the buck stops with me . but if i have to do something about it to be a successful manager i will . `` these boys have to come back into work again . they have to walk past me in the corridor and look me in the eye . they know exactly how i feel about them at this present moment in time . `` it was unacceptable and if it happens again , there will be people leaving this club . ''
NEG mrs t - first serious attempt at the distance/time as gr said ca n't be a 100 % confident unsure of my mp endurance the furthest i have gone is 14 miles @ mp . my race tactics will be to get 20 miles in 2:10 - 2:15 and then hang on for dear life . is this a good plan ?????
NEU right then i would suggest that anyone who does n't want sis blackcurrant gels and/or jelly babies shouts now so that we can arrange to get the special requests to mudchute ... wa - how many gels in a box ?
NEU hi fiona , . just catching up with the thread - sorry to hear the news . i 'm dedicating my run to my father-in-law and a close friend both of whom died from cancer . my father-in-law also had a series of strokes - 2 major ones - so that 's where i 'll be getting my inspiration from at around 18 miles . i 'll most likely be walking like him at that stage as well . sorry that may sound sick but we had some lively banter going on between the two of us when he was alive . he was paralysed down the left hand side but he always made a joke about it and i used to take the mick out of him in return . got us both laughing and he 'll be watching me on the day and giving it back with interest !
POS buena fortuna , mokina ! have a good week-end everyone , and steady on the easter eggs .
NEU annick , try they do baked beans and marmite vests amongst others . not sure if that 's what you were thinking of .
NEU best of luck to everyone in gp 7 tomorrow !
NEU morning , . t map , jej , mrs t , dan a , ndo w , cy , blisters , oo , rb-congratulations and commiserations . great reports . ndo , i hope you are all right . 3 hours 6:51 : for me . 1h29 at half way and just on time by 20 miles , but i had very tight hamstrings which were cramping up so i slowed to a pace that allowed me to get to the finish without stopping . i have mixed feelings this morning . the marathon is such an unnatural distance to run . anyway it 's great to be able to listen to your thoughts about the race and the banter and support on this thread has been fantastic this year . -LRB- people at work who have n't got a clue are already annoying me with their advice and anecdotes . -RRB- . all the best and recover well . no running for me till saturday and i have mayo on my sarnies at lunch today . i agree with dan a - . tapering is over-rated .
POS i said to my boyfriend the other day the nicest people that you will ever come across are runners and vegetarians . i am both !!!!! ; 0 -RRB- . i am happy for you shona . i can understand how devastated you were .
NEG bet i hold the record , i took six on sunday morning before the start !!!!!!!! i know it was a really stupid thing to do but had the runs from wednesday night until saturday morning & lived on a diet of jam sandwiches & 6 pints of watered down lucozade sport per day , though little stayed inside . . this was my third flm & i figured that even if i had to walk most of it , as long as i could stay bunged up i could complete and justifiably collect my sponsorship money . . as it turned out they worked a treat , i managed 4:27 which was about half an hour slower than i targeted before my illness . i was also back to normal service by tuesday morning . . however i would never advise anybody to run a marathon whilst ill , it was the most physically painful thing i have ever done .
NEU hippo im with you . belfast today and still failed to break 3.00 . must be getting old finished in 3.02.38 some 30 secs slower . great new course , hilly tough first half any day now flat second , this has potential .
POS thanks diana ... we 're not off til next wednesday ... you 've got to put up with me for another week yet !
NEU cinders - hope rossi is ok . took the dog to the vets for her blood test this morning - probably wo n't get the results til monday now . i have just come upstairs and found her limping - do n't know what she has done . she was fine this morning when i bought her back from the vets . will keep an eye on her . and if i do n't get on line before you all go off to the in other words - good luck !!!!!! will be thinking of you on sunday and wishing i was there EMO_HAPPY
POS thanks mike , . this will be a new stage for me as all those sessions have me running further than the race distance i 'm pacing at . oooer ! i 'm always up for a challenge though !
POS doing only 12 400s , and with 2 mins recovery seemed like a real doddle compared with the 20 with far less recovery , even though the pace was faster - actually managed 7secs/lap faster than my last 2 20 x 400 supposedly at 10k pace sessions , so i 'm pretty satisfied with that
NEU mokina - glad you are settling down in dublin . have n't got the foggiest how much 17.50 euros is but it sounds cheap , so yaaaaaaay ! lol ! and its not that you are getting older you know . its prohably cos the goal has gone for the time being now that you have pulled out of your marathon - you need another one to aim for . enjoy your shopping slugsta . . tracey - bradley is a star although we do argue like cat and dog at times . my older son laughs at us when he is around - he thinks we are so alike which is why we argue . probably right - if i think i am right i do n't let go and neither does bradley . . i have a very tight calf muscle this morning . its quite painful . and i am still knackered ! i need an early night really but i have arranged to go out to dinner this evening at one of my old assistant manager 's . he got married about a month or so ago and i could n't get there -LRB- his wife used to work for me too -RRB- so i need to go and see them . champers again ... its such a hard life is n't it ????
NEU quote dana . `` will start the bidding on predicted times between me and pug over the next few days . oh dear . . this 'll be interesting . . i 'm having reservations the way i 'm feeling lately . . this tapering is horrible , just feel like a fat slug now ... you want odd pb 's check mine out !!! 5k = 18:09 . 5 mile = 32:42 . 10k = 38:39 . 10 mile = 1:15:35 . 1/2 marathon = 1:21:10 . marathon = 3:32:59 . bear that in mind when you do ya predictions hahaha !!! pug
NEU oh cath poor you , get back down the quacks , i know how pants you feel when you ca n't train , i was like a while back was n't i with that virus that turned into migrane clusters , i did n't listen to my body either and tried to train , try to take it easy untill ya fully recoverd , lecture over , but i hope your feelin better soon , big hugs . pinks i do 400m sprints at 9.5 / 10.0 on the tredmill and 200m recovery at 7.0 on the running machine , my next trick is to set the incline at 1.0 . after downloading that tredmill programme the bloke was saying that by settin it at that your forcing the hamstrings to do what they natrally do out on the road but if its flat then the muscles do n't work as they should and tremill does it all for you ... some thing like that any way , i 'm sure you can word it better rio !!!
POS missed your last post - but you can pick up some fab costume accessories these days , from the high street . next , m + s , debenhams , top shop etc , you do n't need to spend much or go searching far off the high street - i 've had some nice cheap bling from sainsburys even .
NEG pug , why bother with a slow plod around luton . might as well go for a sub-3 and see what happens ; you could always drop out after 1 or 2 laps if it 's not going well . -LRB- that 's what i did last year !! -RRB- . back to back sub-3 's are very possible . rb did it at paris & london this year , and someone else finally managed it at cardiff & ny . plus , sub-3 will probably get you into the top 10 . i 'm currently crippled with a mystery knee injury , so taking a fortnight completely off , for the first time in about 8 years to recover . might go up to watch luton , if i can be arsed to get up early ; i know a few guys who are running , plus it will be good to see a winning performance from the jock .
POS * pops head in * . hi guys , long time no see ! thanks to cg for the email kick up the bum to get me back on this thread :--RRB- . nothing wrong , just been really busy lol ! but not too busy to train - 130 miles so far in 2007 :--RRB- . i 'm in work , this is a bit naughty - proper update later i promise . thanks again for the email cg EMO_HAPPY
NEG only the semis sadly . . dodgy refereeing and italian gamesmanship versus ac milan denied us the chance of a trip to wembley where we surely would 've become the first british team to lift the trophy . charlie cooke , ian ure , alan gilzean ... the `` arabs '' across the road -LRB- united -RRB- were 2-0 up from the home leg v roma but lost 3-0 away in the year grobelaar had his wobbly legs . . we did also lose narrowly to the mighty leeds united side of 1967/68 in the then fairs cup semi final . `` we had joy . we had fun . we had seasons in the sun ... '' .
POS thought i would try out these <u> lovely </u> buttons ! .
NEG toasty you 're a model for many to follow . my valentine 's day post-work has been spent running 5.5 miles @ 8:13 pace round hyde park with my wee boy , followed by a low-cal ham sandwich and grapes from m & s for me ; chicken pasta salad and a brownie for him on the long tube journey home . classy or what ? sciatica very painful now of course .
NEU whats your precious ??
NEG i had an adventure on sunday as i planned to run about 13 and ended up running 17 due to getting lost on kingley vale . it was completely my fault but the mist and heavy rain plus mud did not help . i did a speed session monday , rested tuesday with just a couple of sets of tennis . i can still feel the effects of sunday now , with a slight ankle twist and sore left knee but this is still minor on the pain scale . i do plyometrics , -LRB- hopping helps to strengthen the ankle and i have exercises for my knee which ease the pain -RRB- this has worked well over several months . my plan of sticking to 2 hours went out the window on sunday as i was out for 2 hours 40 minutes . still , good time on your feet . i will go back to 2 hours on sunday and run a 9 miler on thursday . i am still learning what best suits me as stacks of 2 month injuries have meant constant disappointment . however , the last 8 months has been good . i do 20 minutes static stretches after running and now do plometrics 3 times a week to try and keep the injuries minimal and hopefully away . i am trying isotonic drinks , tauts , cranberry and blackberry after long runs to try and rehydrate and recover more quickly . i started on sunday and this seems to help me recover quicker . also , glucosamine and chondroitin , helps keep the joints supple and flexible . at least thats what i hope . i also have changed from icing injuries which never seemed to work for me , causing soft tissue damage if kept on too long , too nurofen gel which seems to help minor injuries recover more quickle . i am still looking forward to the marathon and hoping for a good time . i will aim for 3.30 but will most probably end up with 3.40 to 3.45 . the last 10k is the killer .
NEG i dont think you can defer a club place joe but its still worth asking .
POS first half marathon so is a pb but not a lot to beat ! have done longer runs but they are just trainign runs really . getting into the races now !!
NEU desert man : and i was going to complain about the icy wind this morning !!! - half-mile reps at everything between 6m/m -LRB- very encouraging -RRB- and 7m/m -LRB- very depressing -RRB- . could still feel last week 's heavy mileage in the legs , but not a bad session all in . in terms of sw16 's point , yes , the marathon is a bit of a gamble , but after 3 of the little b * gg * rs , i 'm starting to get a better idea about my strengths and weaknesses , and i can compare race times with last year . for instance , i ran 3.19 off a 1.34 half -LRB- no taper -RRB- . if i can get back down to 1.32 , or even a bit lower , 3.14 should be on the cards . . interestingly , although i 'd always thought that i was more of an endurance person than a speed person , my 10k time is actually my fastest as an age-graded percentage - but that may be because some girl called paula keeps on running marathons relatively fast compared to half-marathons !!!
NEG after missing much of last week due to shooting pains in calf , i managed 11 on saturday with 2 reps of 1.75 miles -LRB- supposed to be 4 but i was being sensible -RRB- and 2hrs 40mins yesterday . last hour was a struggle with my calf , the same as last sunday . hoping that if i can survive the next 2 weeks the tapering will allow the calf time to recover enough for me to get around flm . all the these niggles have rather dampened my focus on sub 3.15 and instead i am looking at finishing being a real goal . yeterdays run slightly ruined by one of the guys telling us towards the end that his watch made our run less than we thought . there again his story earlier in the run about his wife and a pig more than made up for it !!
POS i wore mine at reading and got a pb . . personally i believe them to be magic , go faster laces and wo n't hear another word against them .
POS jj . i thank the lord that rugby and tri seasons do n't clash ! xtrrea finishs , rwc starts bliss ! hope wasps they need to be beaten in the final EMO_HAPPY
POS cheers philpub , that 's quite a strange thing to know EMO_HAPPY
POS dave - the metcheck thing 's hysterical . my metcheck page -LRB- refreshed etc -RRB- for the day is totally diff to yours ! says 15/16 degrees , sunny/partly cloudy . . re meeting times - spose i was thinking i 'd get there earlier than 8.30 , but go to loo , sort self out , dump bag , get coffee etc then meet everyone else . then there 's a bit of time to chat , chill , dash into the bushes because the loo queues are too long etc. .
POS raks that 's an excellent idea , although my mother would phone and ask me endless questions about how to post to the forum !
POS sure this was n't on the website yesterday !!!
NEU i do get tunnel vision , but generally only around westferry and blackfriars .
NEU only you can say if i behaved or not ?? or maybe your oh -LRB- or kids ?? -RRB- . if my oh gave me a freezer for christmas he would be permanently attached to it for a long long time !!!
POS morning all , well done everyone ! bit of a strange one for me , my quads seemed to give up on me after 6 miles ! could n't believe it ! . i set off slower , think i got everything right in the build up , kept my fluid levels topped up , but obviously something not right . i think if i 'd have cramped up after 18 for going off too fast i would 've been disappointed with myself , cos it happened so early in the race after a mile or so of muttering expletives under my breath i managed to see the funny side of it . although the prospect of running another 20m with what felt like two dead legs was n't an appealing one ! anyway i shimmied along at whatever pace the legs would let me and finished in 3:31:29 in the end which surprised me as i thought i was heading for 4hrs + . after realising it was n't my day i made the most of it and took everything in , stopped to see some friends , and was completely blown away by the support , tower bridge and along the dual carriageway were awesome ! it 's impossible not to smile heading down the last 800m ! ca n't really get my head round what went wrong and i 'm not gon na beat myself up about it as it was the experience of a lifetime but i feel like i 've got a little unfinished business with london now ! great effort again all ! . matttherat :3:15:51 . darren larder : 3.18.58 . rowan :3:20:16 . chieftain tank : 3:26:54 . ttt : 3:27:00 . po2 : 3:31:29 . banksie : 3:31:57 . roundhay mike : 3:34:40 . valuxian :3:36:52 . aa : 3:38:48 . rain bow :3:51:11 . smiffie 3:58 . rfj - 3:59:48 . ruscr : 4:01
POS bw , there 's no rest for the wicked then , you 're straight into the next challenge , there 's no stopping you , just how much punishment can you fit into one month ? no seriously , good look and yes , you do need your head testing . gc , enjoy the rest , you 've never earned it more than now , so take it while you can before you have to put in the hard work again . that will come all too soon ! euph , thanks for the york 5k entry form , i 'll send it off today , i entered it last year but did n't run due to foot injury . also sending entry off for wheldrake 10k and hope to get a place with you and beders on that . i think nickm is doing that too . i 'll text you if able to come across on sunday , the weather sounds perfect for marathoners , i shall bring my brolly ! good luck tonight in your club race , you 'll still be flying along , even when you 're taking it easy . clairster , keep those feet and legs rested in time for saturday , you 'll be fine , you know the drill . make sure you text me & let me know how you get on . hey ceal , that 's just blxxdy fantastic , you go girl !! there 's a guy from our club who also runs the masters , usually the 800m & 1500m , he 's a mv35 , so only just turned vet . last year he got a bronze at the world masters indoor champs in poland . hope you 'll be coming away with a medal too , i 'm excited for you !!! looking at that gb flag next to your name must be a great feeling :0 -RRB- . last night we did a hilly , muddy off road 5 mile run , which was great . it certainly made me puff and blow to start with , but the scenery was good and it was a nice change , so a bit better than doing a lung-buster on the roads . today is a rest day , as the league race is tomorrow night , a 5 mile undulating course . i actually feel a bit better , so it 's probably just what i need . i 've also invested in a pair of `` paula socks '' -LRB- knee high flight socks -RRB- to help my tibial muscle , which is still very sore . not that they look very trendy , but if they do the job , then i 'm not bothered . some of the men commented on them last night , but they did n't fancy wearing the spare pair for some reason . physio thinks i will need a small orthotic to help the muscle repair itself , without stopping me running , so going back for fitting next week .
POS keep us up to date with all your glute antics , wabo !!! do n't forget the race reports - really like those . umb - yes - i 've never liked 10ks because they 're too fast . but am looking forward to seeing what i can do on sunday . pity about the hills . worked out the fast 3m of my run today was between 7.5 and 8mm . not very fast really but i really felt it . telling myself it 's because i 'd only had 500ml of lucozade sport half an hour beforehand ...
NEU the pugometer was introduced as a term for gauging performance in a race . i personally do not use a pre-callibrated pugometer . eg . i ran 3:16 at flm , but the pugometer rated my performance as 2:58 , because the weather was quite warm . the pugometer has nothing to do with ranking all runners on this thread as shite . ps . seen someone 's starting up another 2:45 thread !!
POS daz - that 's brilliant i 'm sure as a family you will do very well and it 's something for you guys to share ! vb , pinks do n't be too jealous i still have to go back ! daz you really must run flm again next year ! andrew i ran it for dreams come true this year and will enter the ballot again this year but do n't intend to run for charity unless someone else wants to organise it for me . there 's only so many times you can ask family and friends for money and remain popular .
POS my prediction for jej is 15.58 followed by 10.55 for the 3k s/c . i 'll also be doing a 5k on the saturday -LRB- and probably a 3k s/c about 90mins after -RRB- . i have n't got much training in this week and my week so far looks like this : . m : rest . t : 60mins steady . w : ~ 600m/5km aquathlon race -LRB- 29.00 -RRB- . t : 60mins swim -LRB- intervals -RRB- . f : 30mins turbo -LRB- bike -RRB- intervals ; 45mins easy -LRB- planned -RRB- . s : race/s . my three 5,000 m races this season have all been followed by a 3,000 m s/c and have been 16.24 , 16.55 -LRB- no ` b ' competition -RRB- and 16.22 . if i have to do the 3,000 s/c i 'll wear flats for the 5,000 and probably race at 95 % . if no s/c then i 'll wear spikes and give it everything . predicitons ?
NEU morning all - fotd ! 21 miles went ok - 3-08 on a hilly course . reckon that there were about 500 ft of climbs in total so not bad . . key for me now is to keep it up and -LRB- with all respect to the bangles -RRB- run like a very fast egyptian !! panicking - 7 weeks from now i 'll be lining up at margate . by my reckoning -LRB- this post will go in at 8-51 -RRB- i 'd better have completed it 7 weeks 4 hours and 39 minutes from when this post goes in or else !!
NEG just checking in ... 40 miles last week , with a 3 mile tempo run of 19 minutes into a gale - felt hard ! nothing this week so far - was working abroad yesterday , and with impeccable timing got ill monday night - no sleep and multiple bathroom visits ! crawled home from hrow yesterday to find rest of family laid up with same ! rowan : that does really sound like a lot of money - for what it 's worth i also vote for a second opinion . rfj - thats an excellent idea - i find it so much easier with the discipline of a plan to work around . my application for the ballot also went off at the weekend ... ... ... cheers , nick
POS nice one guys , two new pb 's !! both with uphill bits ! i 'm still looking for the sub 1.40 myself ls , as you say it 's getting closer !!! and is n't it nice to get that elusive sub 45 batw , not sure if i 'll ever get faster but as least it 's done !! no running today , day off after 7 days on the trot so looking forward to a fell run tomorrow me thinks , maybe even in the sun !! a bit quiet again in the holiday season . see ya lata . cheers . beders
NEG i must be one of those strange people who now weighs a bit less than they did for flm -LRB- about 5lbs -RRB- . here 's what i look like with a bmi of a whopping 24.2 and a bleeding nipple : . i might 've featured in some of ww 's pics had he not left me for dust to finish his 40 mins ` last 10k dash ' !
POS tt . nf is still on - we go there lots as a family , so i 'd like to run there . but i 'll take it as a run and enjoy it . i 'm no longer in a rush to get race fit as fast as possible . there will be no more 3 or 4 peaks run in preparation for it though , and if the hills are a struggle then what the fuck i do n't really care . i 've another couple of other race entries that i 've previously paid for too , but again i 'll just treat then as extra runs and enjoy them . my knee and my aerobic base fitness will hopefully benefit in the long run .
POS yes , there do seem to be alot of b days around this time !
POS i once had a customer tell me all about the marathon his mum did - turned out it was a race for life .
NEU good news re . mini wabbs . . my cheque still not cashed so not in for me . well done didds and corredor although i may still have club place option -LRB- as in this year -RRB- . . quads achy after circuits and yesterday 's run . but in a weird way quite like it . off for torture 5 miles tonight with club . -LRB- where i am always at back ! -RRB-
NEG wtgy - i would n't run speedwork by hr although it can be useful to look at the stats afterwards , e.g. to see how well hr is falling off over different recovery times , etc. recovery runs and long runs i aim to stay < 75 % max . with other stuff it depends what the purpose of the run is , e.g. a complete run at ` marathon pace ' -LRB- something approx to your wednesday run ? -RRB- might be around 85 % max , or a tempo run @ around 90 % with warm-up and cool down . fwiw , % max i 've seen for races have typically been : mara 86 % , hm 88 % , 10k 93 % , although that all went out of the window with my last hm where i averaged hr -LRB- 182 -RRB- same as my last 10k -LRB- ?! -RRB- i think i 've found hr useful to keep an eye on for trying to keep a steady pace , but without relying on keeping to some pre-planned level . i like to think i pay less attention to it as i get better pacing by perceived effort . gobi at bushy . 16.45 - tt -LRB- whatever i predict you always tonk it anyway , so i may as well make it a little stiffer for you this time -RRB- . 16.48 - padams -LRB- as long as it 's 16.02 or slower -RRB- . 16.50 - philpub . 16.57 - mtr . 17.01 - gobi -LRB- sods law it will be windy and wet !!! -RRB- . sorry to be anal mtr but for consistency i 've removed your colon . fnick , fnick !
POS no , just from highams park - was 5 miles . only back up to 10k at the minute ! yes , just read about paula , inspirational ! my brother -LRB- he was on the bus with us flm 07 morning -RRB- , ran his first dublin marathon last monday . 4 hrs dead . fab time for him .
NEU is n't the gnr flatter ?
NEU i followed the advanced marathoning 18 week up to 50 mile schedule in 2006 and improved my flm pb from 3:16 to 2:56 . in 2007 i did the 18 week up to 70 mile schedule and did 2:50 . this year i 'm planning on doing the same as 2007 with two changes . i 'm going to try and run the last 5 miles of my long runs at marathon pace -LRB- 6:17 -RRB- to try and improve my ability to maintain speed towards the end of a race and i 'm going to do tempo runs instead of track work . i 'm aiming to go sub 2:45 which i reckon i would have been pretty close to last year if it had n't been so hot . i 've found the above schedules easy to follow . they are almost two easy in that very few of the sessions are high intensity and i always panic that i 'm not doing enough . however come the big day they have the desired effect . if i get a sub 2:45 i 'm going to jack in the training and run my last marathon in 2009 off the elite start dressed in a huge scooby doo outfit . that should guarantee me a slot on the telly !
POS i 've found that one of the best things about keeping notes is that they stop me worrying that i 'm not doing enough . i 'm running 10 + extra miles per week compared with last year , but generally feeling a lot less tired . and i do n't have to rest all afternoon after an 18 mile run . 9 mile club run at 6:45 min/mile last night .
NEU morning all - feeling very tired this morning - running a half marathon followed by a party involving several glasses of wine - not a good combination ! however , buoyed by yesterday 's success i have just entered another half in march as it lines up with distance for lsr on the same day . so , although course a bit hillier hoping i will have gained a bit more fitness by then - although i have a 20miler the previous week so maybe not ! tutu - still a great time . i was looking at the results trying to work out which was yours . were there any team prizes at the awards ceremony ? . wore my skins to bed last night so the legs feel ok - just the general tiredness/slight hangover that is not so good ! : - -LRB- thankfully hangoiver not as bad as feared after three large glasses of wine . dtb - great to hear the pat strap thing works . hrr - good to hear you 're back on top form . really must get some work done - ca n't procrastinate any longer !
POS . can you believe that our charity ... the blue cross have placed themselves up 2 flights of stairs ? yikes ! after a long run , i love a glass of cold milk and some hazelnuts . hope they have some as a reward for dragging myself up there !
NEU i 'm back and i 'm stinkin but i 've got 11 miles under my belt EMO_HAPPY . more news after my shower . . EMO_HAPPY
NEU i hope you will all take responsibility for my letting go so beautifully , as you advised , and now have eaten my way through two . snowballs , a fry-up , chicken curryand rice , fish an dchips , oh and stewed apple yogurt and honey . heeeeellllp !!!
NEU does n't look like it !! . but i 'm sure there are lots . by the way - i 'm running for children with leukaemia - they have hundreds of runners but not a single thread here in the forum ...
POS wow what a lot of soft mush you lot talk ;--RRB- . tutu - have you ever considered that if you stand at the starting line it may be because you are slightly bonkers and those that did n't get there may be the sensible ones ? susan - have a good rest , you deserve it after your almost long run !!
NEG oh dear hana ! i really do sympathize ! i have been absolutely unbearable for the whole of this month , and will no doubt be the same until i get to the start line , either this year or 2009 . when i am pain free i think its possible , but then when i try to work out the remaining days and what to do , i start to think it is increasingly unlikely that i will start the race . . mrs puffy had to defer once , and there is simply nothing to be said or done , it is thoroughly miserable and frustrating and anyone that tries to cheer you up just has n't a clue . it must be even worse as you read about people doing their last runs and beginning the taper . i reckon its got to be up there with a major accident or losing your job . . just do n't send the form in till you have too . -LRB- and do it special delivery -RRB-
NEU bizkit , i think we are getting a wee bit nervous and excitable . -LRB- hana 's fault -RRB- . we shall calm down now .
POS i put this on the macmillan runners thread last year ... now i lay me down to sleep . i pray the lord my health to keep . if i should panic before i wake . i pray the lord my fear to take . god bless barley , beanz , all group 5 runners , supporters and runners from the other groups , the mad lady from group one celebrating her 50th on race day . btw , i am not particularly religious , i just like this .
NEG gatton do you work for argos ? i used to work for them , the branch in kingston upon thames . it 's gone downhill massively since i worked there though . . obviously cause i left -LRB- but maybe other reasons like halving the shop in size , for example ! -RRB- . anyway , just popping into this thread to give my details for the support group . forum name : annajo . name -LRB- suggest you email this if unhappy to divulge via the forum -RRB- anna . race number 10386 . estimated time to mile 17 somewhere between 3-3 .5 hours -LRB- aiming for a sub 5 -RRB- . what you 'll be wearing green macmillan vest with ` anna ' on the front , over a t-shirt -LRB- probably black long sleeve -RRB- and black leggings . any special needs * tell me how great i 'm looking , even though i 'll be looking knackered ! apart from that i should be ok , i 'm carrying the equivalent of the kitchen sink with me !
POS aha - you 're right judderman . my head is very kind and knows i am running for charity . i too am planning on doing penny lane . i have the entry form in my briefcase that i printed out yesterday at work !! might even manage waterloo 15k which is may bank holiday but only 3 weeks after flm so will have to see . will enter it on the day probably . will do penny lane though as my target is to get speed back this summer over 5-6 milers .
POS nah , it 'll be scott ! well done hana - like i said , it 's already on sky + so looking forward to sitting down with a very very large glass of a decent rioja and watching you on monday evening !
POS just wanted to say a huge good luck to jason at katrina for tomorrow - hope you have a great run and enjoy the atmosphere !! katrina , hope the cold is gone . roo - well done on your pb ! sorry to hear about your friend 's baby , hope all is ok . xx . roo/legs - i will prob watch on tv , but if i can make it down i will text you .
POS thanks alex ! ywould love one , you are a star . . will sponsor you on weds when i get paid though as no money in the world right now ! will email you then once i 've done it . how did you get on yourself this year ? stomach behaving better ?! ;--RRB- your story from last year was my all-time fave !!! EMO_HAPPY
POS morning all . sounds like some good running going on again now . i 'm feeling a bit like mr blobby for some reason , but will hopefuly get back in to it soon . cruisin . good to see you back , and a huge well done for raising that amount . fantastic . tutu . my pb for 2008 flm was around 31 mins improvement . bound to be someone with a better one i guess ? . i was dead chuffed with my time 'till i found out a 67 year old in my running club , beat me by 3 mins , with a 3 .42 . that bought me down to earth with a bump !
NEU oh bowi i 'm sure we 're all going to miss you EMO_HAPPY . was it something we said or your new job ? you must be sure to pop back in to let us know how you did on the moonwalk for sure .
POS watched it all the way through today - thanks alex. i am on screen for about 5 seconds but hey it was worth it lol . you 've really worked hard doing these dvd 's for everyone - well done !!!!!!!!
POS didds - having said that a sub 3:40 at abingdon is quite appealing !! -LRB- umbongo slaps himself round the face for having such silly ideas -RRB- . my targets for the rest of the year are sub 1:40 half , sub 45 10k -LRB- and then as close to 40mins as i can -RRB- . i have my first club 10k next week which will be my marker and then they do one in july and one in august . the july one will be my sub 45min race and the august will be to get as close to 40mins as possible . i am down to do windsor half in sept -LRB- the same day as new forest half ! -RRB- . i am booked in for my london to oxford bike ride in july -LRB- may see wabo there or not -RRB- . i read the rw article on lance armstrong and quite like the idea of combining cycling into my running training blah blah blah
POS 6th july , i am free , now dave do not knock this off !!!!
NEU brian - great racing , sounds like you 're going well . coro - i keep intending to do something at a watford open meeting , but never get round to it . a 3k might be interesting . let me know if you decide to do one and i 'll try to come along .
NEU cg that 's a big big lr for a hot day , very tough . + good run joolska too , you will fly when it cools down -LRB- prob for the rest of the summer -RRB-
NEU a lot can change in a week . having bailed 2 attempts at a 10m pmp run last week i nailed one last night to the point that it became a long tempo run rather than pmp . 10.38 m in 73:30 = 7:05 mm pace . was half tempted to carry on to try to log an unofficial hm pb as this is 10s per mile inside my current hm pb pace and was still feeling strong . ave hr 160 . very pleased . not sure what was different . i am transistioning into new trainers at the moment - most of last weeks running was on old ones with c 700m on them so extra cushioning may have helped but i think the biggest difference was just generally feeling up for it and wanting to get things back on the right track . the other factor may be that i had had about 3 weeks running mostly off road hilly routes culminating in borrowdale leading upto last week 's training so have had to readjust to running faster on the flat again . anyway - feeling more positive again so i 'll enjoy it while it lasts . steady 5.5 m this morning and hoping to squeeze in a cheeky visit to the track on the way home tonight which would make for a rare double . . cg - get well soon and do n't try to fight it . i had 10 days off with some sort of lurgy/man-flu in march . it was right at the time my training for flm should have been peaking but i just did n't feel like running so i did n't -LRB- was also v busy at work at the time -RRB- . i 'm sure i limited the damage by resting rather than trying to run through it .
POS yep , ady , yogs is def running with a ballot place . well done fp - another bod to cheer along the mall ! err , sorry lads , not doing beachy - like i said earlier , too much carp in my life . ticking along with about 3 runs a week at the moment just to keep a -LRB- very -RRB- low level of fitness - and it clears my head a bit from all the rubbish that sswfw puts in it ! x
POS you know how i always advise folks to run lots of 10ks !!!!!!!!!! still no pug ?
NEU great race report tutu sounds like fun . might have to give it a go sometime . as for guy fawkes , i did n't do it . i 've not run more than 10 miles yet since hurting my back so i decided togive the race a miss . ended up at the metro centre all day looking at prams and other baby stuff instead . got out for 9.5 miles last night , really slow and i 've not yet recovered my ability to run up hills as i had to stop a couple of times on the really steep one close to home . i know that when i can run up it without stopping then i 'm back to full fitness . . it an early bonfire party tonight with fireworks etc -LRB- no idea why it 's done a day early in bishop auckland but it is -RRB- so it cross training in the gym at lunchtime with a couple of miles on the treadmill . ozy
NEU was n't that shake 'n' vac ?
NEG i 'm backing off a bit this week after last week 's big week . niggles are niggly , especially yesterday when i had to drive to maidenhead and back for a meeting . worse for my legs than anything else - struggled through a recovery run in the late afternoon . rice last night and my legs are a lot better , but i do n't have the work window today to do the planned 14 mile run -LRB- lunchtime and evening meetings -RRB- , so i 'll fit in a 6-8 mile run at some point in the day . work is going to be very hectic in the next few months , as the charity i run is merging with another -LRB- larger -RRB- one . loads of meetings , documents , due diligence , lawyers , accountants , etc. etc. ontop of my normal job . should all settle down by the end of april - thus potentially ruining my whole training plan for london . we 'll see . . welcome mp , there 's some good stuff in this thread , but a lot of other stuff to plough through to get to it - 8 hours might be optimistic ! by my calculations that 's about 40 posts a minute to read . marigold - nice to hear you 're reentering the land of the living . i reckon i 've been virus-free for 10 days now , which might be a record for the last 6 months !
NEU i think all the quick treadmill running is definitely an indication of frustration of plodding through snow ! if it goes ahead i think conditions wise wokingham will be the complete opposite of last year . it was as close to perfect conditions as i think i have run in . oh well , pbs all round ? and claim an extra min or 2 on the old pugometer ! ;--RRB-
NEU sue c wrote . mm - you know an awful lot about cycling ! do you have a background in the sport ? yes EMO_HAPPY i still consider myself a cyclist even though i do more running these days than cycling . i got into cycling 20 years ago through the excitement of the best tour de france ever won by greg lemond and have followed it ever since . done a fair bit of racing but time constraints since my daughter was born have caused me to take up running to keep fit - bizarrely doing marathon training is easier -LRB- timewise -RRB- with a family than trying to train for time trials or road races . . caterpillar girl - v jealous of the fact you 've got your 5 x longest runs done already . i ' ve got another lsr planned tomorrow -LRB- weather permitting -RRB- but i 'm building up over the next 11 weeks to get them all in rather than getting them done early on . pmp - i 'm with xps on this one . i try and fit in 1 x pmp pace run of an hour every two weeks to ` practice ' running at target pace but my take on it is that you should do varied runs throughout the week to work on all aspects of your fitness - lsr , pmp , intervals to develop your vo2 max , recovery runs . the only thing missing -LRB- at present -RRB- in my weekly schedule is a medium length run of 10-13 miles but this is something i am planning on introducing to increase my miles shortly .
NEU a lot of thought has to go into my signs . do you know how many clip art pictures there are out there ??
POS i think those who dont put on weight should take some of the rest of our weight as they burn it off easier . anyone watching london let us all know where you 'll be so you can cheer us - if its still light by the time i get past --
NEG he 's right though emily . it 's really tough when you want to do it , but better in the long run to miss it than to get properly injured . yes a swim later might be good as then you have n't got the pounding . i know how you 're feeling .
POS i 'm back from my fab weekend in carlise . lovely country house hotel , too much food and drink and no running at all . will have to get back to it tomorrow . watched the boys play rugby in sleet and gusting wind . was totally drenched and freezing cold afterwards but good games . got back to hotel for lovely hot bubbly bath and a bottle of champagne ! ah it sounds like the exams went well . hope you hear soon as the waiting is often harder than the exam . what are longest lsrs that people have planned ? i thought i read that someone was planning 22 and 24 ? is anyone going over 20 ?
NEU morning everyone ! heading off on my 16 miler . not sure if i should go the roads or the old railway line . railway line is traffic free . hate trying to make decisions when i 'm sleepy !!
NEU wibble !!! i was just thinking where i 'll be this time next week . my friend just has a baby two weeks late , maybe this is how she felt . you know it 's going to hurt , but ca n't stand the waiting !

NEU wotcha peeps ! nam , i sent you through a rather hideous photo earlier , am hoping you got it okay ... i 'm nowhere near brave enough to put it on here !!! i 'm off to the expo on friday , is it odd to be slightly jealous of everyone who 's gone today ?!! :-p . k x
NEG they are great at going slow . at least pen and paper people all had equal chance . iv been trying most of the day and got as far as enter ballot before crashing . i missed out last year to so will be even more disapointed again this year . get rid of that big red screen !!!
POS brilliant hen well done ! just checking whether abingdon does have a women over 60 category it does not look as though they do ?
NEG the photos were not good last year . i felt i wasted my money . hopefully they are of better quality this year .

POS afternoon all , . tr - happy birthday mate . i decided on a10k off-road race last night instead of track - good decision , really nice run . 36:30 and 6th place . it was in the grounds of alnwick castle/estate for anyone who knows the north east -LRB- or harry potter -RRB- . . well i 've finally managed to find a embra number ; & not ;-RRB- . just need to ; . - work out how to get from pen xxx to pen 1 as the number is 10 , xxx . - pick my moment to mention to other half ?? - work out where to stay or travel early morn . - start worrying about the weather . right where is that racers list !!!!
POS tr - happy birthday for today . charle w - belated congrats on your sub 3 . i was also wondering what are the main differences between the new and old p & d book ? is it worth buying the new one if i have the old one already ? 8 miles for me again and trying to build by base up in prep for abingdon and nice and steady . cheers
NEG viola ! psi : bet that does n't help !!!!!!!
NEG just for the latest update , someone else wanted the same weekend as us and had beaten us to a provisional booking . . so far he hasnt paid the deposit and he as until friday to do so . if we fail to get that particular weekend then i have reserved the following weekend . so either way it will happen - just when rather than if . regards
POS thanks for the reply , have just emailed you .

POS can anybody help ... have just treated myself to a polar a5 . for my long slow run i 'm supposed to keep my hr at 65 - 70 % of max . however , monitor reads 84 to 90 % but i feel really comfortable , . when i slowed to 65 % and i was just faster than a walk . . toooo slow ! have been running for a year post baby , have lost 2 stone another stone to go and really looking forward to my first marathon . should i listen to my perceived exersion level or the monitor ?
POS pizzaman . cheers for the encouraging words ! i did my 1:26 half marathon in 2001 and ran flm that year with an injured friend which meant finishing in 4:31 to make sure the slacker finished ! i 'm keen to see what i can do at the fleet half since i ran a 10km pb three weeks ago and training has been going well since then . i take your point about the pacers - i 'll try and use them as a ` ceiling ' for a 3:15 finish . a further concern is that i think i 'll be in the 3:30 pen at the start and it might be a bit of a battle to find my way to the 3:15 pacer . . god , its going to be a fun day -LRB- assuming i get there ok ! -RRB- . the bat
POS well the mind is a powerful healing tool !!
POS laugh out loud monique :0 -RRB- .
NEG not worth throwing it all away , but certainly not worth serious or permanent injury . if the pain is still there after a few days rest then think seriously about giving this year a miss and defer to next year.have had to do this myself for this year.disappointed , but having done the race 2 years ago , it 's not just a case of `` only another 6 '' at the end . they were the hardest 6 miles i think i have ever done.better to be running in next years race than not being able to run at all.sorry about the doom and gloom outlook.my brother had an knee injury a few years back and decided to do a race anyway . he now watches me from the side as he really knackered his knee up.if the body says it hurts , do n't do it .
NEU wolfy . i was looking on trianline but i 'll try virgin and gner
NEU ... and when it 's finished you might throw up . sorry - that ' the sort of thing i should have kept to myself EMO_HAPPY
POS mwah , caz , thanks.see you at the thistle ...
POS nearly as good as the archers this !
POS mands . i 've been taking multi vitamins for couple of months now plus a codliver oil capsule a day and yes they do turn wee yellow . thought i was ill first time i noticed until i twigged what was doing it . good news is i have ` nt had a sniffle or owt since started taking them so must be good i guess or just lucky . andy makes a good point - i tend to want to pee just before a race several times and will probably be worse this sunday ! good luck everyone . mike
POS i have faith in you saqib !
POS i know of a very good one that covers north london and ec1 area . call brendan on 07950 233466 . he charges 30 pounds an hour .
POS congratulations spans . . maybe it 's only non-veteran males that has been changed . well , pre-2002 there was no gfa scheme for us at all . going to have to negotiate time to train for and race the robin hood marathon now to break 3-hrs . not easy as skip junior number 2 is due one week before !
NEG ok , so i 've filled out the form but should i send a stamped envelope for them to send my number ? once somebody put a note in telling me off because i did n't .
POS st giles hotel arround the 80 mark for a very nice room with sports facilities tottenham court road tube station .
NEG only 32 weeks to go !! , well minus christmas weeks cos no one runs then so thats 30 then there 's the taper three weeks before so . 27 oh and of course you 'll have a couple of colds over that time which take a week or so to get over so 23 , ah but then there 's a chance you 'll have a birthday between now and then so thats a saturday night out on the beer and you do n't want to be running with a hangover so 22 ah and of course there 's injuries . bound to have one in that time , which take at least 4 weeks to get over so . .18 . ah forgot new years eve which leaves you with a hang over for at least a week . oh and of course there ; s all those sunday mornings when you really ca n't be bothered to get out of the bed because its raining . oh and the wedding aniversary and wifes birthday , both of which you are expected to bring her breakfast in bed and take her out for the day . so that leaves 4 weeks !! then there 's all the d.i.y jobs she expects you to do on sundays that you have n't done because of all the hangovers , birthdays , and bad weather , so that leaves us with one week to train ... hmmmmm think i 'll defer till next year !
NEU hi all . just to clear up a point . i never knocked the abingdon , just saying its a small race in comp to d flm . what is n't ? i 've heard a few good things about it and it fits nicely between flms . so im defo considering givin it a go . woony
NEU the line was blue last time i looked andy - think you 've been on the drugs ;o-RRB- . i personally think it 's important to do lots of long runs to avoid dying at the end . i do n't go for the over distance theory , but i 'm aiming for several 22s as well as a couple of 20s .
NEU when is the melbourne grand prix ?
POS flm they organise so many trains to get there it is not a problem , i get coached to the start but then all i have to do is be up in the morning and on the bus !!!
POS mark , let us know if the zinc works for you . good luck for sunday .
POS < looks around innocently > `` whadisay , whadisay ? ''
NEG meerkat - i keep trying to access your site but there appears to be a problem . i keep seeing a picture of a ginger minkey - surely that ca n't be right ????
NEU i think i might go for a swim on saturday morning - really gentle . thanks for the exercise skeezix - i will have a hot bath and a stretch tonight . someone at my club suggested it might have just knotted up when i started tapering - fingers crossed . carbo loading - i am slowly increasing the carbs but trying to take on some protein as well to help with the healing - lots of tuna and mackeral ! i am trying to take on enough water as well but do feel a bit dehydrated so moving on to energy drinks from tomorrow .
POS bad luck adam - find a good physio , mine suggested it was my greater trochanter muscle and lower back and hip joint inflammation . she gave ultrasound/tens machine type thing/back & hip massage and loads of stretches and core stability exercises . 2 weeks of no running just swimming and 4 physio sessions sorted it out completely . anyway , you could n't have done 13 miles without training , at least hold on to that . you 'd have done a great half-marathon . what about the loch ness marathon ? my sister helped to organise it last year , then ran it and it sounded great . i did n't meet up with anyone beforehand as i was sprinting across the field to the loo - that was before i knew there was a half-hour wait !
POS good idea , it 's a lovely day , i 'm going for a long walk ! thanks everyone EMO_HAPPY
POS oooh , jpvd , you 're sooooo keen ... :--RRB- . 8 miles easy for me today so prob . i wo n't be joining you . have a nice sunny nostalgic run though ! ca n't remember where womble but i definitely got a push as you went past me . i 'm assuming you 're the guilty womble as we ran a similar time . do n't worry i wo n't be seeking revenge ... . much ... . . ;--RRB-
NEU hi monique , . which ironman are you doing ? i did my third run last night after the marathon , a club 7 miler , legs still heavy ! i think on the back of my current fitness , i 'm going to do another half marathon on may 16 and then possibly another marathon on 13 june in devon . i 'm determined to try and run a more tactical marathon and not start off doing 6.20 miles !! my only difficulty now is a training schedule post marathon ! i 'm not sure when to start doing speed and harder sessions !
POS 35833 surely . so it 's still cool and quite remarkable . nice one daniel !!
POS hi all . fairly quiet on the thread at the moment , like i have been myself a bit really . ran home from work last night , usual 7 mile route , which was quite enjoyable , as it had stopped raining by then and was warm . i 've realised that some days you just feel good , like you 're flying along -LRB- like ashley -RRB- and some days it 's just not going to happen and i 've had quite a few of those lately . 2 weeks ago i had a good day and finished the same route over 2 mins quicker , even by not even really trying , so i think your body has natural ebbs and flows of energy , it 's just getting it right . tonight i 'm back at the club and we have planned a recce run of the last 10k inter-club league race , which is a week today . this should be fun , as it 's got some sharp hills in it apparently , just hope i can hang onto the mens pack . tomorrow i will probably run a 13-miler from work , then saturday is rest day and sunday is track & field . training seems to be all over at the moment , due to various races and leagues , but will get it right . i 'm thinking of doing newark half marathon on 8th august -LRB- instead of darlington 10k -RRB- which i had planned , has anyone run this before or know anything about it ? hope you are all flying and looking forward to the weekend races , if you have anything planned . cheers . sarah :0 -RRB-
NEU very interesting smashy - i 'm amazed that you think the course/conditions could make 13 minutes of difference -LRB- assuming paula is in 2:15 shape given perfect conditions -RRB- - it must be an absolute stinker of a course . and poor tracey morris if it does end up taking her 2:45 - hope she has some people to run with at that pace or it might be quite a lonely race for her .
POS this sounds fantastic ! dips , would you say it is better to go on one of the earlier camps in january , in order to get all the principles in earlier ? or is it best to sign up for late feb when i 've built up a bit more endurance ?
POS wow - that 's wonderful . thanks guys !! thanks for taking the time to type all that out , joby ! will post my application this evening . EMO_HAPPY

POS hi waldorf - like the guys say you 're more than welcome to join us the more the merrier ! hope everyone had an excellent xmas ! hs - sorry i did n't get back to you on the boxing day run - as we were out all xmas day - i had no pc web access - and had to get out early boxing day morning - before dinner prep -LRB- i should phone or text you in future i guess -RRB- - you 're right it was really frosty and cold - but such a beautiful morning - i did a 5 miler and got back home feeling on top of the world - new mp3 player helping . . did anyone get out today for a run - i did a a 5 miler including 4 hill reps up mill hill - only to the bridge though - was really tough but felt great afterwards . hope you are still ok for tomorrow cc - guess you are mega busy at the mo. new running kit sounds good normski - anyone else get any kit from santa ?

POS jaq , . just started thinking of hotels , saw your post , checked website , hotel looks good , price as yours , so i 'm booked in . london marathon contingent of two at the comfort inn . any others ?
POS the initial objectives of the london marathon -LRB- as set out by chris brasher -RRB- . * to improve the overall standard and status of british marathon running by providing a fast course and strong international competition . * to show to mankind that , on occasions , the family of man can be united . * to raise money for the provision of recreational facilities in london . * to help london tourism . * to prove that when it comes to organizing major events , ` britain is best ' . * to have fun and provide some happiness and sense of achievement in a troubled world . flm does not and never did exist solely to raise money for charity . but on the other hand charitable objectives were there from the start . . i still believe that all these objectives can be part of the london marathon
POS do n't cwy podds - i 'll stay wiff you :--RRB- . i 've decided to treat the whole thing as a learning experience . runs will be for training purposes only therefore - slow -LRB- what else is new -RRB- . not gon na race or even try to -LRB- but then again , i 'm not competitive like that so that wo n't be hard to stick to -RRB- . we 're gon na ` ave a real good time . bit of a larff while we learn . god i 'm sooooo excited !!! . must calm down . must calm down . must calm down . etc. ...
POS excellent trinity , we getting ourselves put about ! i also looked at the dartmoor event ... quite fancy that now , without reading all the details do you do it in pairs ? . i usually do the lovely jog shop 20 .
NEG here 's a silly question . i 've never done an ice bath . how exactly do you set one up ? do you just throw ice cubes in a tub full of cold water ? and is it okay to start by just submerging your lower legs in it ? my injuries are usually concentrated there .
POS on the morning of the marathon or any long run i will have a bowl of porridge with a mashed up banana and runny honey on top , it 's like rocket fuel and should give you a good start .
POS jamesk . it is also my first marathon ... but i 'm going to make sure i 've got lots of vaseline on those chains ! see you april 17th ! cheers . gdave
NEU bs . i 've been in a similar situation myself when i just could n't cope with even 50 miles/week and when the long run became more than half the weeks mileage . i ended up copying a guy whose weekly training pattern went : race , rest , rest , train , train , taper , taper and race . joke training ? perhaps . but i adapted it as a salvage job for marathon training . one difference was that the long run was on a saturday followed the next day by a 50 mile bike ride . ok result too .
POS apology accepted ! well , enjoy . . and come back tomorrow morning and tell us all that you survived . .
NEG dont know htp , is that a garmin gps unit or something else ?
POS katypie and diana d - hope your 16 milers go well . i 'll be trying for 18 tomorrow . katypie - you 're a bit keen - edinburgh 's not till june !
POS helen - true ! aa - i have considered it - how long would you have to spend jogging in the pool - whow long in the pool equates to what in terms of miles ? would appreciate some advice on aqua jogging ! i 'm seeing the osteo again to day so i will ask him about it as well . i 've only had 3 days off - but i 'm already beginning to feel like a right lardy any day now it doesnt help that people keep bringing chocolate into the office !
POS i do n't know!i turn my back for 5 minutes and all this tri - stuff comes out of the woodwork again - i wonder if anything can be purchased to deal with this infestation ? ;-RRB- . alp - sounds like a good run you had - hope that massage irons out those aches . cc - next time you are creating with the gold spray paint etc. - give me a shout - sounds like fun - you 'd probably end with 3 times the mess though ! normski - hope that treddie ache is temperorary !
POS jj - sorry to hear that you are n't going to make it this time around . but hey , there will plenty more marathons for you when fate is being kinder !! i hope you pop back in here often to cheer us all on ! good luck with your 10k times . EMO_HAPPY

POS i think that whatever marathon you enter you have to approach it with the knowledge that every marathon is different for various reasons ... location , size of event , sponsorship etc. of course the bigger the event the greater the likelyhood the crowd support will be but ofcourse the flm is a league unto it 's own . in regards to future training ... there is a wealth of information on the internet and on this rw site for marathon training depending on what time you want to achieve . the easiest way to find a training schedule is to ` google ' `` marathon training schedules '' and choose one that works for you . jamie , . the key to keeping your legs going on a bit longer is those long traning runs ... getting a few 20 milers under your belt will help in addition to fine tuning your carbohydrate loading , wearing a good pair of running shoes etc etc. the flm is a fantastic marathon but it is n't the only one ! there are plenty of other great marathons out there for you to enjoy . happy running !
NEG well i dont `` run '' them do i. if you had been asked to walk 26 miles twice-well you could yeh ?
NEU hi specky . sorry to hear about your back . what did you do ? . shame about robin hood . i 've just completed my first week 's running post flm and managed to do 17 miles which is n't too bad going . going to try a long run tomorrow , not sure how far to go as i think my legs will feel it . i 'm dithering about how to approach my training now . blackpool in 7 weeks , then a 10k the week after and another 10k the week after that . glutton for punishment or what !

POS brilliant result gg - many congratulations and may you be celebrating in style ! had a friend staying this weekend so was planning on taking the whole weekend off , but did manage to fit in a quick run this morning - bit of a blast with a couple of good hills and nice to get outside as so much of my running these days is just on the treadmill at lunchtime . must say , running outside really is far more enjoyable by far and as beders points out -LRB- good long run by the way -RRB- , it is necessary to get used to running on hard surfaces . spent the rest of the day shifting stuff to/from the rubbish dump in anticipation of moving to a smaller place in london and now i ache all over , so not sure what state i 'll be in to do any running tomorrow ! bm - do you recommend the total immersion book ? was thinking about getting it as keen to learn breast stroke and then my `` challenge '' to myself post hong kong marathon is to learn butterfly -LRB- looks like a great workout ! -RRB- . hope the xc went well sarah - thought of you today , as it 's like a mud bath down in kent at the moment and i almost got stuck on my way back when i cut through the back of the park and did the 100yards off road . not as cold as it has been , but still chilly enough that i ran in tights , 2 tops and jacket + hat , gloves , scarf today . welcome boing and david - the more the merrier ... make sure you join in the chat and banter and let us know what you 're up to and no need to lurk EMO_HAPPY
NEU found the thread ...
NEU i 've just signed up for a few races too - taunton half and fulfords five in exmouth . i want to do the bideford half in march but there is n't anything on the website at the moment and the braunton 10 - ditto . if i 've got a few races to look forward to early in the year it 'll keep me motivated . have n't run in a race since torbay 10k in august - shameful !
POS hi everybody first reply so please do n't shout , i have been following some of this and just to add my view i did a few 16 mile runs to and from work about 3 weeks before i ran the cardiff marathon last year . i knocked 12 mins off my pb now 3.14 . i found doing 2 runs in a day gave me a lot of confidence . i am now aiming for 3.05 at flm 06 .

POS karen hancock . hi ! i think i saw you -LRB- plus a couple of others -RRB- running past my house -LRB- canberra road -RRB- this morning -LRB- 11:10 am -RRB- . looked like you were giving it some wellie ! made me feel a bit dispirited as i guess you were nearing the end of your long run and i was just doing my pre-run stretching session , with 21 hilly and muddy miles ahead of me ! still , i 'm back now and feeling quite good , having done what i had planned .
POS cheers , andy ! i was a runner in distress !!
POS saqib - good luck for the weekend ! i keep meaning to go onto your charity page and donate - will do soon . let us know how you get on - we want a full run down ! orient - good luck tonight . hope you get some good news soon . good news ! i 've lost 2lbs already - only another 12 to go !
POS hi hh & sdi . thanks for the replys . mrs j did the pengiun plan for her first lm & came in at 5:25 just 2 mins after the pacer . he stopped for a toilet break at 8 miles so she did the rest on her own and never saw him overtake . in the mag i received today it says they do usually 7m/ml up to 12m/ml in min intervals so hopefully they 'll do an 11m/ml which is what she wants . it says to preregister go to this website so i 'll have a look around . . thanks again for trying and good luck all . -LRB- beginning to feel a little jealous though have bigger fish this year . -RRB- . regards . jt
POS littlemiss - . well done on your first 10 miler ! your next goal should be to enter a half marathon as soon as convenient . if you 've done 10 in training you 're nearly there . you 'll be amazed how much more confident you 'll be about the marathon once you 've got your first half under your belt . and running in a race will give you a little idea of the atmosphere on flm day ! good luck !
NEU hi all , . i just want to wish everyone the best of luck with your training and the marathon . much to my dissapointment and frustration i think i need to drop out . . EMO_HAPPY
NEU ttm i hope i have a similar experience as my 10k pb is currently over 44 mins , and i do n't plan doing one before flm , but i hope -LRB- expect ! my hm pb is actually quicker per mile than my 10k pb -RRB- i could improve it . i have found my achilles seem to suffer as my shoes wear out . recommend running off road , as the knackered cushioning has less detrimental effect . mind you , if you live in london this might not be so easy . . ca n't advice on brooks or saucony shoes , tried neither .
NEU yeah just looked at 2005 results , maybe i should hope for number 23 in 23rd place ? might be more realistic ! took a quick look at 2004 results , field was a bit slower that year so top 10 might have been achievable !! not sure what the weather was like that year though ?!
NEG wilde rover , you wont get anything until march when you get the next magazine , i assume just like everyne else . when i ran for a charity i got the app form and youre in magazine from them and then anything else came from flm but as i say not till sometime in march .
POS rossendale eh ? know it well , did the rossendale half a couple of years ago , tough but excellent run , started and finished at marl pit athletic track . we had sun , rain and hail that day .
POS helloooooooo ! sorry for the long absence . it 's been a pretty rough few weeks . nevermind , it 's all back to normal in delia world now so i 'm back and not going to be writing the dreary things i would have otherwise !! i 'm so glad to hear that you 're all doing so well . i ca n't wait to hear all of the race reports after the big day ! i was talking to someone at work today about my flm experience last year and now i 'm horrendously jealous of you all for being the lucky ones doing it this year !! nevermind , i 'll just have to get my pb at stratford -LRB- aka hippo 's b ` day mara ! -RRB- in may instead ! ps i totally agree that mr beckham was looking scrumptious on wednesday evening ... oh how i love him !! EMO_HAPPY
POS rowan - great time today , hogmonster you too mate - must have ran a similar course to me . gazza brilliant - i am in awe of you all . i am obviously on the wrong theread if i can only manage 3:54 for 20 so i will not bother you again and slip off to the sub 4 thread . but i will not give up and this race will not beat me . i will be back . thanks for the encouragement and good luck all
POS morning , . how are you ? it went really well ! weather was good , the support from the crowd was amazing for a half marathon . i ran 1:54 by my watch , so was quite pleased considering the fisrt 5 miles are all up hill !! on the whole felt good and was glad i entered , broke up the training , was a nice change and with the hills you could class it as a long training run i suppose . . how was your weekend , birthday celebrations go well ? training going well for both of you ?
NEU bagels . and more bagels .
POS london is like no other marathon , beleive me , you wont need any music to keep you going ... .
POS thanks mate . tough night tonight i am watching a tape of carry on camping its so funny updating club records and drinking my ovaltine . and catching all the running news . . nice session easy 7 tommorrow . i am a charlton athletic supporter and pround of it , apart from the painfull end of season usual fall apart .
POS hello guys and gals . i have a straight back now but must rest for two more days as a pulled a back ligament had caused the problem in the first place . light 2 or 3 miles saturday then easy 20 at the stroke run on sunday i hope . still 5 days of rest might help re charge the batteries for chasing t & t man at paddock wood in a weeks time ??? thanks for the support everyone
POS thanks fenn . decided to put something in there that was more inspiring for me ! i sprinted for the last 300 yards or so on sunday . in my head i had a big grin on my face but it does n't look like it from the photo . my son said that if i had that much left in me by the end i should have run at a faster pace throughout the race . he admitted that he might be wrong when i had stopped punching him .
POS always aching . we seem to be in the same boat . i was after 3:30 but also will be v. happy to get 3:40 and a new pb . but this bl ** dy cold better hurry up and shift . also got a new pair of shoes to wear in -LRB- mizuno elixir . . nice -RRB- . great running everybody not long to go before the taper
POS aber , that 's some kind of cross training you 've got going there , not sure my legs would take kindly to any high or long jumping . bfb & rob , good luck with the long runs , nice and steady does it and leave some good recovery days in the schedule afterwards . sb , sorry to hear you 've been ill , maybe a sensible decision to lower your horizons , hopefully you can enjoy the race with less pressure and still get that big new pb . nl , i 've been doing all my mid to long runs in some nimbus that mrs h bought me for christmas and i thought they were really heavy to start with , my marathon shoes will be mizuno precisions , mostly phsycological i know but they feel much ` faster ' !! last ` big ' speed session yesterday 8 x 800m fast off 90 secs jog recoveries , averaged 3:03 per rep , with a couple of warm up/warm down miles total just over 7 miles . last medium long midweek tonight 12 or 13 . keep well now everyone .
NEG >> fabric softener . ? i was told once to avoid using much conditioner -LRB- is that the same ? -RRB- with technical kit , because it reduces the wicking effect . could be wrong tho ' .
POS ox - excellent , well done . how do you know what colour start point we will be in on the 23rd ? is it to do with your expected completion time , your run number or some other method ?
NEU you can take the dlr greenwich to mudchute , -LRB- in the direction to bank -RRB- , the supporters stand almost within sight of the exit . you can plan your trips -LRB- or check on travel conditions -RRB- within the london transport system on
NEG gazza that 's sick !
POS bb - thanks for all the fabulous organisation . . i am intrigued - your vest in your photo ... is that from ` tough guy ' ?
POS hi sweetest , enjoy your run later . i went out yesterday , so might go tomorrow for a little one then 6 planned for sunday .
NEU mark1 !! noone asked me the lap dancing question !!
NEG sanps - hippo will copy and paste . do n't want the rfg guys to think i 'm bullying them .
NEU me ? only lurk -LRB- and occasionally post ! -RRB- here or scottish runners . or threads to do with ipods !
NEU nj - why is the green start , much sought after ? - tell me its a millionth of a second quicker ? . a clutching at straws ouchouch . looks like we will be running with a world champion in our midst on sunday , in last nights evening standard , james cracknell looks like he 's very much focused on sub 3 . pass me a bagel - good eating everyone .
POS hi all , . best of luck . i am getting so paranoid , someone nearly hit my car today , and i slipped over - what a nightmare ! am really excited . picking my number up on sat afternoon - bad time i know . tinkerbelle , i am staying at novotel waterloo as well on sat and sun with hubby -LRB- is n't running -RRB- and two friends -LRB- who are running -RRB- and their hubbies -LRB- who are n't -RRB- .
POS love that idea dn - let 's do it . ca n't do 7 june though - sorry oo .
NEU james now look here . you have just done a bloomin mara . cut yourself some slack . baldy -- you need a flat one darlin . and not crowded . abingdon ???????
POS how good to have a surprise hol jane . hope you had a lovely time . ph hope birthday was good . sorry it 's belated , but i seem to have missed it earlier . cinders - i think i will take your advice . i 'll pop into dusseldorf at the weekend and see if i can pick one up . good on you roobarb with the disgracing - has to be done every now and then ! hope everyone else is well . i 'm having a good day today and learning lots . also just been told that i wo n't be needing to pay for my lunches anymore as i will be getting them free from now on - hurray ! they have a fantastic canteen here with things like steak -LRB- cooked to perfection -RRB- , duck breast , stir frys , salad , all to a really good quality so i 'm not needing to do much cooking myself as i 'm having a really good feed up at midday . and now it 's free ! anyway must go - i have to write up all the things i learnt this morning before i forget them and can no longer ready my handwritting !
POS lw5 , flm06 was my first marathon and i could n't believe how exhausted how felt for weeks . i 'm gradually getting back in to my running now but if you 're struggling try introducing walk breaks as this will have a mental benefit as much as anything esle . if you 're running for , say , 5 minutes , stop and walk for one minute and then do the same again all the way to the end of your run . you can eliminate the walk breaks once you 've fully recovered or take less of them if you 've got used to the strategy and its advantages . at flm06 i walked for 1 minute at the end of each mile up to 20 so even towards the end i could still keep going by saying `` only 9ish more minutes until my next break '' - i ran without breaks after mile 20 . i recovered much quicker because of this strategy and i 'm still using it now . i ran 3 miles 3 days after flm , with walk breaks , of course ! give it a try and see if it helps . best of luck .
NEU pinks speed sessions are usually pretty much flat out bursts of up to 1/2mile 90-95 % hr . a tempo session is a more sustained speed session up to 1 1/2 hrs . these are done at about 85-90 % of maximum hr .
NEU jej - pbs by the dozen ... was the 1500 another slow-run race ? . dana - ah the kebab-shops of nottingham . i used to be an expert in em back in my student days ... but yeah i know what you mean - i think i 've been cranking it up a bit now that the clothes have come off . where 's your money for the cricket dan ? good morning session for england . . is it the first yately this wednesday ?
POS gd - just doing 13.1 m in this heat is an achievement . i got up really early to run my 12m , started really slow as legs felt a little heavy after yesterdays hill session , then picked up the pace a little , felt nice and easy , came home in 1:34 -LRB- av 7:50 -RRB- . started cool , ended very hot , took on almost 1.5 litres , and have been drinking ever since .
POS pugs . if your 18.09 was a pb then i would n't worry . you 're still getting faster , and you 're not injured .
POS tmr : . i agree with the not blasting off statement you made regarding xc races . in the local sunday league races , last season i blasted off with the leaders and by the end of the race was holding on . i then ran the bigger xc races such as the southerns -LRB- mike gratton will remember that one ! -RRB- and the nationals at parly hill . i started off very steady in these races , let my eager team mates shoot off in front , then spent the whole race , slowely picking off runners , in fact i overtook all my team mates and made up around 50-60 odd places and finished feeling pretty strong as well !
NEG just phoned to find out when my form would be posted out only to be told they had n't received my letter requesting one . same goes for the oh 's letter too . will get another letter off in the post tomorrow . just as well i checked though .
NEU sorry to read of so many with injuries . hope you 're able to get back to running soon . daisy d , if you have a question for mike grin then yes post it on here and i 'm sure he 'll answer it . :--RRB- . mike , out of interest are your schedules suitable for all levels of runner or do you need to have a background of a few years running at a reasonable mileage first ? i 'm planning to start your marathon schedule at the beginning of dec after a goal 10k race . would i be following exactly the same plan as last year and also should i expect to be starting from a slightly higher level and be seeing slightly faster paces on my steady and lt runs ? at present i 'm running steady paced runs at around 7.50 pace on a mildly undulating course .
NEU nothing gone from my account either . although a cheque for 40 which was highlighted yesterday is now not highlighted - i take it any transactions that should go out today would be highlighted now and there arnt any so that means nothing going out of my account today me thinks -LRB- why are my posts so complicated !? -RRB- . wonder if the flm organisors are sat in their offices reading this and laffin at us cos todays not the day anyway !
POS katepie . well done .
POS well done everyone for running today . i have ventured out today , but only so far as going to bingo !! am now 60 quid up so quite a productive sunday ! the goblins have left the premises now too , thankfully . . i got my flm rejection letter yesterday too , forgot to say . .
POS hippo . you did well today . how did your christmas shopping saturday go ?
POS ws : . happy birthday !!! now then did someone just mention birthday cake ???? laugh out loud
NEU thanks , glugg , where have you been?what are you up to ?
NEU ok - hydration . smut over . i used a large runner 's aid bottle -LRB- one with hole in the middle -RRB- for anything up to 12 miles . anything over , i use a small camelbak and a bum bag for gels .
NEG hiya hippo . she nearly set the house on fire with them once . she left them on and went asleep . where are you getting that extra extra extra large turkey from ?
POS happy new year everyone . the real training starts now ... well when i 'm over the massive hangover i have .
NEU ahhhhhhh . ive a mara on march 11th

POS just popped in to say have a good weekend everyone - happy running !
NEU joe , that is how i fill , it is the frist glass after that did it for me last year , i did 13 miles on sunday and side after i have 15 weeks to go , not lone now ,
POS hi , mn EMO_HAPPY welcome ! stick around and see what you think . . when the thread started , not all that long ago , i 'd never done a sub-2hr half-marathon . hrr , i must confess that i 'm not drinking any more than usual . not because i 'm genetically half-cactus like the person who wrote the rambling letter to that effect in the current rw , but because my fluid intake is quite generous anyway and because i do n't sweat enormously . and before a long run , i carbo-load so well that there 's probably enough water bound up with the glycogen in my legs to keep me going . at this time of year i only take drinks on runs lasting over two-and-a-half hours . obviously it 's different in summer .
NEU hi dm/all . you are spot on about the club situ , i was with a club , now moved up to the hills and became slower , now that l run by myself . can l ask those people that are following a schedule , how comes they are doing so much milage above the weeks sessions.do they benifit from the extra milage ? / what sessions do they add it too and finally , have they put in their schedules befor and benefited from it all ? .
POS thanks bowi . how do i know if i have the seat at the right height ? when my leg is in the most extended position should it be completely straight or slightly bent ? also if i am doing it for cross training do i have low resistance and go faster or is it better to have higher resistance or is it just about doing a certain distance in a certain time ? i did 5 miles in 21 minutes .
POS a from e. wonderful ! best nights sleep ever-counting sheep.my uncle farmed sheep in the bowland area-i recall him counting in this way . lsr 15 miles then 10 mile race next week . gc dont worry about switching , as long as you get your lsr 's in during the training period , and do not overdo weekly milage !
NEU alroight bab ! i 'm a brummie who didnt get in flm , but have everything crossed for grn . praps flm 2008 so if ya dont moind oi 'll pop in from toime to toime to pick up some hints n tips .
POS evening all , . very impressed by everyones 's efforts . i did 16 mile lsr on sunday in just under 9mm 's and felt very comfortable which is a good sign . never run that far before so pretty happy with the progress . cant wait for the brighton hm in 2 weeks time ! anyone else doing this ?? bit sore after squash tonight . dont think i stretched enough . being a physio i should know better ! looking forward to the fun of the hills tommorow night ! cheers , . jules
POS sounds like a wonderful post marathon treat ! wonder if i could persuade the oh ? what are you guys going to do to celebrate ? my running club has a party on the night of marathon we have 22 out of 66 members running .
POS daz i just realised that your time is faster than what i did the brighton half in last year !!
POS cool if you 're a formula one fan ! . bowi what were you doing in nepal ?
POS ah good mokina . you have options . they shoukld be wooing you
POS good luck with all of the lsrs this weekend guys . as predicted i have done nothing this week but had a great conference - got some excellent results and had some real fun , but workload , late nights and booze have not helped to get me motivated to run . rugby at the weekend together with long drives down through west wales and then cardiff will mean no running till monday and then it gets cold ... but it will have to kick off whatever the weather . have a good time all .
NEU anyone doing cranleigh 21 or worthing 20 ?
POS here 's a bizarre thought . my mother just sent me a text , to say that my ` symptoms ' sound just like when my ` skinny and weak ' younger sister had anaemia - i 've tried nigh on everything else - look like a few irons pills and some guiness then . ws all the best . i 'm most impressed with your return to top form . eb - ive been advised that the best splits for mortals are 49.2 % and 50.8 % , so 1h 28m 30 ish for me .
NEG cinders . sorry i meant thanet 10 . just got a text from hippo , she is coming up to 20 miles .
POS welcome tallbird , sounds like some good running there and a good time coming into flm . you have some sound mileage behind you too . at , well done on completing the last lsr , sounds about as inspiring as mine , but it 's done and in the bank now - thank god !!! sb , welcome back , glad to see you 've returned to form quickly after your exams and rest . gc , many people have already covered the taper question . mine is planned as 24 , 16 & 10 -LRB- about 10 days out -RRB- which also includes a 10k race and speedwork on a weekly basis . ideally 3 weeks is good , but it can be done on 2 if you taper more sharply . . dfd , thanks for the taper article - a good read . not long til boston now ! keep of the grapes . cl , i would go for the 3 mile race , it will be a nice sharpener and you can use it as speedwork . i personally think higher mileage weeks are the key to a faster time , particularly when you 've reached a plateau like i have in my last 3 marathons . you seem to be doing just fine . ceal , well that 's just blxxdy fantastic !!! what a great time , i 'm so pleased for you , it must be a fantastic boost coming into flm too - all those great miles training and now this - yipee ! lor , welcome back , sounds like a good plan to me and you 're on target . lf , that sounds like a good idea - an easter bunny outfit - might be a bit hot at hamburg with it on though . i did n't have a good time at training on thurs night either on the track , so just kept it steady , felt crxp . beders , the canal run sounds great , what a different good company can make , wish i 'd come with you guys now , but there was no way i could 've made it time-wise . you were all flying along , sounds like you were doing cartwheels at the end . i found i felt stronger from 20 miles on too , hopefully it 's a good omen . hobble , sounds like tired legs and let 's face it , we are all bushed at this time in our training . do n't be too down about it , as you 've put in some great training times lately . ozzy , good to hear you are nearing a full recovery & you 're tootling along at 8 min miling again , which is n't that fast for you . text me and let me know if you 'll be there on friday , when you make a decision . clairster , well done on your lsr too , we all seemed to hate it apart from beders & co. i too ground to a big halt when the garmin bleeped at 24 miles , which i think was more mental than physical . i went home and slept for 1.5 hours after that , cold and lsr wiped me out . . nickm , catch up with you thurs as re-arranged for race on fri morning . let me know if you fancy doing 15-16 miler together at mp over same weekend . i also received a 20 voucher for `` up & running '' in the mail on sat , which was a nice surprise - a prize from last week 's ackworth hm .
NEU ta : . i hate to admit , it but i am too !!
POS susan . i estimated 4 hours in my original application and i 'm in pen 5 - so i guess that is where to go for . i think pen 4 might be the keen 3-40 types that we are not worthy of being associated with !! starting to get close - nervous and excited ! its shimmering heat on the course today -LRB- my office is just past the 19 mile mark ! -RRB- .
POS learning how to do the samba ! lol . night night xx
NEG dread to think what you might have found in your dish after 9pm !!!!!
NEU put your stats up anna
NEG i reckon it should say we should aim to run 7 % slower . me being a bit dense , i never adjust my plans , run at my normal pace & blow up at 18 miles . end up walking & lose half-hour .
POS i ran for jdrf which funds research into cures and causes of type 1 diabetes . a friend just popped in with some sponsorship money . she 's got two diabetic sons and is besides herself with gratitude for my efforts . she said if there was ever a cure they 'd sell the house and live in a caravan if it meant they could pay for treatment to cure their boys . feel quite emotional about it .
NEG i had to raise 2,000 for breakthrough breast cancer , but i was talking to someone during the race who only had to raise 950 . i forget which charity it was though . dark blue vest , but not anthony nolan .
POS how do you think you 'd do if you ran it kp ? can you see how you feel later in the week ? choc muffins sound yum !
NEU time for a quick totp before i head to the gym ?
NEU s-c - again , i will be following your training with progress as i am launching another attack on sub 3:15 myself a few weeks prior to your marathon . . the mhr test was self tested doing the session you suggest . the problem being that i find it hard to push myself hard enough running on a treadmill even with my friend standing next to me shouting encouragement . what are your hill sessions ?
NEG bowi i am with you about oldies trying to tell you waht they used to do . i qualified for a swimming teacher back in 1981 and a karate -LRB- shotokn -RRB- instructer in 1983 and a gym instructor in 198 4 but would not even think of telling people what to do as things have changes so much each year . how long ago was it that runners had never heard of gels etc .
POS just been checking out the two oceans website . 35 miles . one day . the same little voice that sat on my shoulder this time last year and whispered , `` sub 4.00 marathon '' is beginning to mutter at me , `` two oceans marathon '' . . most of the route 's wonderful . we 've spent two chunks of time in cape town and it 's beautiful round there . def some big lumps of rock around though -LRB- think table mountain etc -RRB- .
NEU sc i am sure you can calm this down again with a little common sense . little race news from me . 28.56 for 5miles today , i was a little flat today but this is still my first official time under 29mins . some way behind my 8km split at woodley but then i have been a little busy plodding and resting lately . EMO_HAPPY have a nice day
POS dot - i think it 's the same , but i do n't look back in races so have never seen his face . he generally beats ronnie o'sullivan , his local celeb rival in the essex scene . the results are up already . it seems that most people are 40 - 50 seconds down on last year . two members of coronium 's club who went sub 33 last year were about a minute up this time . the winner seemed to have a very good race for 32:44 . the guy closest to me -LRB- who beat me by 6 seconds -RRB- has bagged a couple of decent hms this year . nm2 - it 's a great site , set up by a club mate -LRB- hence the inclusion of my times from the days when 33:35 was more like my 5m time -RRB- . it gives a whole new angle of post race analysis - especially in xc where i can see how those around me compare on the roads .
POS hi nicky , good to hear from you . hope you get better soon . and rio , hope the foot is improving after ice and rest - what bad timing ! debs - do you get rw mag ? if yes there was a separate flyer in it about a 10k in sept in epping forest which looks good . have you ever run there ? i never have as i would n't like to go there on my own -LRB- and i guess i do n't like mud very much either ! -RRB- but i 'm v tempted . if you do n't get it go to and click on puma urban escape .
NEU although vb i think bucks/oxon tends to be a bit more affluent that delightful romford , so you may find we 're a bit cheaper than in your neck of the woods !
NEU ah now . i wear shorty shock absorber shorts for massage therapy . what did physio say ts ?
POS sorry guys gagging to tell you , but want to leave it to nearer the date for reasons that will become apparent when i spill the beans . i fly out a couple of days before the race , so i 'll certainly let you know before i take off . jej i think i 've got a good chance if there is n't too much wind , and the course is n't too hilly . i expecct to hit the start line a couple of pounds heavier than for flm07 , but should be about the same weight as when i ran abingdon last year . my main worry is cramp , but i have a cunning plan in place to avoid that , courtesy of my triple iron man clubmate . he acted as a pacemaker at abingdon , and watched me suffer on the way round . i 'll be taking what he takes to stop it . hopefully it should work . 7.30 pm ?!!!!!! not confirming anything .
POS jej i ' l go 16:05 ... tipptop -LSB- / b -LSB- i 'm racing the burtonwood 5 miler tomorrow . . just a steady 5:40 -5:45 m/m i reckon . . will do me ... lovely weather out there for a 14.2 miler ;--RRB- . pug
POS oh my god a girl pops out for a little retail therapy and you guys gossip like crazy ! sorry rio if i 've missed you but good luck for the weekend - will keep checking tv listings . gatton i 've already wished you well for your physio appointment . i 'm in for the half but am confused whether it 's mk or brighton ? sm where 's your picture ???? daz are you practising being bashful by removing yours ? what 's going on ? vb you have to ditch the cow print knickers pleaze !
POS rio - congratulations again - you truly are amazing . ca n't believe that you 're even contemplating going out tonight ! gatton take it easy on wednesday !

POS lf , congrats on your new job , once you 've been sat at a desk for a few hours , you 'll be bursting with energy and itching to get your trainers back on . great run at a cracking pace , the previous run was obviously your body having an ` easy day ' but i often feel like that . euph , yes , looking forward to selby hm , but have another long run -LRB- around 12-13 miles -RRB- to get in on friday , then i 'll start looking towards the taper next week , with some strides and shorter sessions . i 'm hoping it wo n't be too windy , unlike today , when i 've almost been blown off my feet . where is haltemprice btw ? was looking at your list of 10k races , as trying to find a good 10k course . ceal , thanks for your comments , now that it 's getting towards the xc season , i 'm having to look a bit harder for 10k on the road with a good course , hopefully i 'll find one soon , as do n't have one planned at the moment . dfd , the mental images which your post conjured up were just mad , you take it easy on those step ladders and running to school - do n't want any non-running induced injuries on the thread ! could you please impart some of your mental pre-race strategies , as i 'm really interested . eddie , welcome back , you 've been very quiet over the summer and will no probably steam in with a marathon pb at leicester . ozy , great run last night and it 's even better when you 've run that far - you feel justified in eating as much food as you like , well done . clairster , that sounds like an excellent session , which turns out to be even better when you 've run at a pace like that and did n't even realise it . ls , now you know you can achieve anything , no barriers , no mental obstacles , sub 1.40 awaits in your next hm . have you got a garmin ? stick to the pace like glue if you have . did a pretty hard session on the track last night with the club , which was 16 x 1 min efforts , with a decreasing recovery , so first rest period was 45 seconds , then 30 , then 15 , then 1 min , repeated 4 times . just when we thought we 'd finished , we had 500m jog recovery , then ran 1000m , which i did n't do at full pelt , as would probably have crocked myself , but still managed 3.57 , which was n't too bad at the end of a work-out . today is windy as hell here , the trees are bending in half . i think wind is one thing i hate the most as a runner . rain , snow , sun , etc i can cope with , but wind is very energy-sapping , the only thing worse is when it 's combined with rain or snow . 4 miles at lunchtime at a fairly steady pace . plenty of races at the weekend , with the biggies including gnr & berlin marathon .
POS tt . la rochelle is indeed -LRB- allegedly -RRB- a flat course . its a 2 lapper , which i know not everyone likes , but i 'm happy to give it a go - looks a bit fiddly at times round the old port though . its been won in a 2:11 -LRB- men -RRB- and 2:37 -LRB- women -RRB- in recent years . be a nice weekend away if nothing else !

POS evening all ! nowt to report , just popping in to say hello . . did a really good weights session a the gym today but i 'm shattered from it now ! . ts , glad to hear he got the right verdict , just sorry you had to deal with it all .
POS i do like a good debate and it looks like i 've missed a few good ones on here today . i 've got a new run plan i 'm moving into , moving things on from 4 to 5 runs per week in the next month . most of my mileage on weeknights is with club due to increased work hours , so i 'm going to take advantage this winter by doing as many miles at the weekend as i can . tuesday -- club night -- as with ppb 's varies but with slower talking pace at the start culminating in hard surges at the end . a few regroup stops so i consider this an easy session . wednesday - short , easy . the run i 'm most likely to dump . . thursday -- club speedwork , tempo run or fartlek with the fast group . if not the club then i 'll do tempo or intervals . saturday -- at this time of year this is my ` have some fun run ' . one of only two weekly opporutunities to run in the light . trail , hills , maybe both , but not too hard . sunday -- when i 'm not racing this is lsr day . in marathon training last time i was anywhere between 20 miles early on to 50 later in my plan - tended to bounce between 35-45 as would only do a 15m + lsr once every two weeks . my average for the last two complete months before marathon month was 160 , so roughly averaging 40 mpw . i 've never run monthly mileage that high before or since . i think i needed to run 20m in a run and then get another 20 in through marathon-paced or other sessions each week . its what i needed to run a good marathon at windermere . i also went out my way to run hilly routes which built my confidence for tackling an undulating/hilly marathon . do the same for flm and you 'll be quids in as you 'll have energy to burn on the long flats of the flm . this time i want to do more , i 've planning to hit average 30 + mpw by december , and 40 by mid january . my plans involve over marathon length races so i may try and push on beyond 50mpw on occasions . like nick i 'll ramp down a week occasionally . nick - glad you enjoyed -LRB- endured ? -RRB- bishop wilton , if anybody ever tells you east yorks is flat you can now force-feed them their empty-words EMO_HAPPY . that hill to the east of bishop wilton is mean , as mean as the one at gf10 but without paving to get grip from ! that was the significant hill at our xc there - i also found a few boggy bits . oddly the rest of the course was easier than this weeks at drewton woods nearer hull , but that one hill took enough out of everyone to make the rest of the course a painful affair . bounding back down it at the end was n't fun either , the sort of steep , bumpy , uneven descent only beders could enjoy ;--RRB-
POS ah - great news re . paris , just need to get your hip sorted out now . at present i plan to do all 3 marathons -LRB- i have done 2 in a month before and felt ok -RRB- - friend did london and stratford last year and he is in his 60s and he managed 4:20 and 3:57 . he ran london with his son and because it was a training run and no pressure , he really enjoyed it . my plan is to treat two of them as training runs and one as a serious pb attempt . on the basis i am not a paula and doubt that i will be digging deep into my last reserves in any of the runs i should be able to recover easily enough -LRB- who am i kidding -RRB- - plodding hippo does them all the time so why not - aim is to get up to 10 and then retire . didds - sorry to hear about your ankle .
NEU jc ... if you have 70 members you should be getting two club places ! . up to 50 is 1 place then a place for every 50 thereafter , ie 51 = 2 places , 101 = 3 places .
POS i 'd like to vote for mouse as i know she is a determined creature and she would love to go sub 5 hours . i feel certain she would value the training and it would inspire her to beat her mara pb .

NEG week seven day three wednesday . my schedule says 7m -LRB- approx 56 mins -RRB- steady . my timex says 7m in 56 . 40 ... it did n't feel steady on the tready EMO_HAPPY as i said earlier i tried to focus on ' running tall ' and keeping my trunk stretched . the pain in my butt ock diminished quickly and i tried to stare at one particular point on the wall in front of me and ran towards it ... i kept my form for about 6m but the last mile was a real struggle and i could n't keep the right body shape . but i got there . splits all around the 8m mark apart from the first and last ... i can feel the pain in my butt ock again now and i know that no matter how i sit it 's going to hurt to stand up , but once i 'm in motion again it gets better . in the morning i 'm going to play around with the seat in my car because i suspect the settings have been changed whilst it 's been repaired and then serviced during the past fortnight . i 've never understood why people who work on cars never ever return the seat to the position they found it in when they got in . . it 's one of my soapbox topics ! grrrrr . . EMO_HAPPY . i have a new problem . . on monday night during the hills i clipped a kerb with my right foot and almost fell over . i think i must have jarred my big toe because i woke up last night and it was throbb ing and it 's doing it again now . it 's a funny colour too . after the miami marathon which trin and i did last january this particular big toe went a funny colour and the nail died . . and in fact it took about 48 weeks to fully grow back again . the last time that happened to me was after i broke a big toe but i do n't think i did that in miami . but it 's not happy at all at the moment . . EMO_HAPPY . i had planned to run 5m tomorrow , this being the run i did n't do last saturday when i brought this week 's runs forward by 24hrs . however in the light of my currrent aches and pains , and because i have no idea when i 'm going to get home tomorrow evening , i 'm going to take tomorrow as a rest day and have 2 days off in a row . steve mc i hope this is ok ?
NEG oh to get back to doing 18 miles ... EMO_HAPPY

POS jd & rfj - good luck for east hull 20 tomorrow . drk - happy birthday - retirement , that sounds good . am heading for a career break myself , hoping to take a year to 18 months off to spend loads of time with family -LRB- been working away for 5 years -RRB- and put fulfill a few ambitions . i finish mid may and ca n't wait . thinking of triathlon for next challenge as will have the time for more training . lorenzo - sounds like a good race , bet you feelt great passing others in second half . must learn how to do that in the last 6 miles of a marathon - any tips ? 7.5 miles for me this morning with a few sprints mixed in , ready for a long one in the morning .
POS well done everyone on their long runs ! great to hear they are going well . i did mine yesterday - 18.75 miles in 3hrs 20 so pleased with that , and also the longest ever run before but knee is aching a bit so i need to take it easy again this week . wondering if i could have a bit of advice from steve if possible ? i 'm due to do the bath half at the weekend , though the schedule says 18m - should i go for a few miles before / after and do it at slow pace / marathon pace depending on how i 'm feeling , or should i be happy just doing the 1/2 ? i 'm not going to go all out again as doing that in the berkhamsted 1/2 meant i had trouble running properly all week with very heavy legs . thanks very much !
POS bootsie - have a nice weekend . ts - hope you get your leg sorted . i am hoping to see you at beachy head this year .
NEU aah that looks more like ... ... it wind and rain . time for my run !
NEG bootsie , . do n't worry about missing training this late on unless it is because of a medical problem - sorry ankles will clear up and most training now is topping off and contributes to only a small % of your fitness compared to what you have accumulated so far in the bulk of your work .

POS dot - good summary . good to see everyone getting excited/nervous about the approaching big day & hellip ; its what all the early mornings , running in sleet etc & hellip ; is about -- and hopefully it will worthwhile for everyone . i am trying a different approach to tapering this year , basically less of it . last 21 miler tomorrow to make up 81miles for the week . i intend to do around 65 miles next week -LRB- with all out 10k on the saturday + a very slow 12 miler on the sunday -RRB- . then drop to 26 miles for the following week -LRB- including 2 rest days and a 12x400 blast on the tuesday -RRB- . this is a result of finding the running a lot easier this year & hellip ; probably because i have run , and got used to putting in , a lot more slower miles -LRB- i.e. 7.30 / 8.00 mm -RRB- . it might be wrong but will see how it goes on the 13/4 .

NEG rob , on another site someone asked who ` the nutter from blackheath who led the race was ' , seeing the state jamie was in when i passed him at about 19 miles i assumed it was him !
NEG people who have multiple partial entries , i would n't worry too much . if you read the pages you would have seen that multiple entries will make all void unless due to technical problems . if you 've got two entries where you 've filled in all details including payments , and got confirmations for both , then worry . if you 've only gone part way through before it crashed then i should think you 'll get sorted in the end , even if it 's a pain . i guess in such cases they 'll automatically delete entries with only partial information . they are not going to count an entry without payment details are they ? . someone asked if they were registered if they were getting a message that their email had been used for a registration . my guess is if you did n't get past that page probably not -LRB- or at least only a partial , see above -RRB- . it 's possible they are using cookies : little files that say you 've visited a page that are stored on your computer . if so in some cases people could be getting this message but flm has no record on their system of your visit : it 's all on yours . personally as i 've got a confirmation from worldpay i reckon i 've got some proof , and i 'm letting things die down a bit before i get onto them . i think if i had not got either email and i had n't got to the payment stage then i 'd probably try again , and sort out multiples later if it came to that . but without definitive advice from flm i guess everyone needs to make their own mind up what 's best to do for them .
NEU i did n't have my name on my shirt . a pity now , as i did n't realise how much shouting there would be . the mp3 players one is a difficult one . i can understand people wearing them . some people may have the music they need to get them through a hard session . i suppose its habits and whatever makes you feel comfortable . . there are quite a few marathons in america where they are banned though . interesing topic of discussion .

NEG ah , back in the day i was one of the strange people in camden with my bright red extensions and many rings in my ears/lip/nose . i can imagine the frubes there running around asking lots of embarassing questions .
NEU jools , . ok you 're the boss , i 'll be quiet . i just wonder about 10ks and intervals when you 're rehabbing . just been for a hammer on thr bike , round some lanes . it 's a fair effort to average 20 mph esp with that long cllmb out of portsmouth .
NEG sue , i was going to pop it round . sorry to leave you to last . anyone else who is not on the list if you mail me -LRB- or have mailed me -RRB- i will double check and confirm with you whether it has been sent or whether i have still got you to do .
POS evening all . fantastic run for me tonight with the club - mostly off road with a few tough hills but managed 7.5 miles at 7.59 pace so really pleased . especially as legs still feel quite tired from the weekend . at least 3 people commented on the speed i ran - ` someone had their weetabix this morning ' etc EMO_HAPPY . hrr - before paris i had plans a -LRB- the very unrealistic by that stage sub-3 .45 -RRB- b -LRB- sub-3 .50 , also unrealistic -RRB- , c -LRB- sub-3 .55 -RRB- , d -LRB- a pb -RRB- and <u> e </u> -LRB- sub-4 .00 -RRB- ! so i completely understand . i was telling a guy from the paris forum about how many fallback plans i had the day before and he thought i was ridiculous , said ` what 's the different between 3.50 and 3.55 ? ' etc , but i know there 's a huge difference - in my crazed mind anyway !! even though sub-3 .55 does n't ` mean ' anything , i would have liked to have got closer to 3.50 than 4.00 . i knew it was silly ! it was strange , i simply could n't keep up 3.55 pace at paris , and yet at london i 'm pretty sure i ran 3.50 pace until well after 20 miles ! sorry to start babble about myself , strange how thinking about edinburgh has been making me reflect about paris/london so much . have come to lots of conclusions about both but wo n't bore you with them . . will absolutely totally be rooting for you all on sunday . remember all your best mantras and mental tricks everyone and run like the wind - with the wind ! . ah - i do n't remember the wind bothering me that much last year - i was just too busy being grateful that it was n't hot like london . do remember a small stretch along the coast when it was worse than other times but nothing too bad , really . . by the way , i know i mentioned i had been perusing the abingdon website recently , but i just realised i am doing cardiff half that day so no worries about getting tempted now - phew !

POS nts - i know i should n't laugh but that is a very funny story . i hope you are ok . passing out is a serious issue -LRB- that goes for padams as well -RRB- , take it easy . the only time i have ever come close to fainting was while i was in the operating theatre with mrsc while she was having a c-section . tt - 31m , wtf . it sounds like you are ultra material . marigold - sorry to hear about your continued problems . i hope you get back to 100 % asap and get a few more wins . bej - wow , that is some serious mileage . 8m ` steady ' @ 5:56 m/m today . still got a bit of a niggle with my thigh . currently in toulouse where it is very hot/humid , but hope to get out for a few miles early tomorrow .
NEU so what 's the cut off time ? do they have cut off times for each leg as well ?
POS nice one jools . as has been said you can only beat what is there on the day . echo jap 's comments . few beers and bbq to re-dress the balance this evening . certainly nice about the cooler conditions . got lost across wimbledon common meant only did the 18 and not the 20 i was hoping for . ccnba to add them at the end . . bej - 80 % @ 5.36 is pretty nice . usual run from coro !

POS brief running history : started 6 years ago when i became a london cabbie just for a bit of exercise.entered my first race 18mnths ago and have been steadily improving with each race , am nearly 41 and have just clocked 34:31 for a 10k on a rain soaked muddy surface so there is definately more to come.my best half marathon is 1:19 , that was in march but i should be a lot fitter now , i train 6 days a week , about 50 miles and have always used runners world schedules and pace calculators which have been spot on so far . my predicted marathon time is 2:38 which is probably quicker than my cab !! i currently weigh about 8st 7lb so im looking more like a kenyan by the day !! it would be great to run london i 've heard so much about it from other runners , so good luck to everyone who enters this competition .
NEG ah tarkers , i fear you are exhibiting a lack of charity and tolerance there . try running past a football stadium on match day and you will be dodging past fat , pie-eating groups of lads . but , you ca n't complain . it means all the bigotted , over-aggressive oiks in one place , letting off steam on each other rather than their families and other innocents . . or , 11am sunday morning past your local church is going to be frustrated by tottering old biddies trying to get into the lord 's good books before it 's too late . again , can you really begrudge this last desperate act ? they 've paid their taxes and fought wars for us . and now ... in credit-crunch uk , the last thing we want is that those with the good fortune to have the means at their disposal to stop spending . yes , quentin 's new iphone -LRB- undeserving little brat though he may be -RRB- means a shop assistant keeping his job , means the sandwich shop he buys his butty from stays open , means the shopkeeper can afford to buy a new house , means that you do n't fall further into negative equity ... yes , tarkers , those people you curse are saving you the worry and stress that could send you to an early grave ... please be a little more thankful in future .

'' . well we all know my opinion on weight so i 'm not going to dig that lot up again , all i know is , i 'll be running so much quicker it 's untrue when this weight is off . my lungs and legs do n't actually feel too bad considering the lack of training . . but when you 've got 31lbs of flab to lose , that 's alot of minutes for free . doing 3 weight sessions per week , nothing to build any muscle this time around , just for strength and definition as the weight piles off . . actually , tonight is shoulders/arms followed by an 8 miler down the club . . now where 's my lettice leaf ? cheers pug EMO_HAPPY

NEU wonder how they are doing - or have done ?
NEU hi steve , my trainers have done 5-6 hundred miles will it be ok to wear new ones and do you think this might eliminate some of the problems ? fl i 'm not sure what this problem is - it 's hard to say , but i , ll be trying my best to get over it . not sure about running 3 times whilst injured , although i 've had similar type of problem after some marathons in the past -LRB- but i 've always put that down to giving my all during the run -RRB- . i was n't right for new york and should in hindsight have pulled out - but if you go all that way - then you got to run !
NEU barley , . please do n't assign me to a particular group as i wo n't be at mudchute the whole time and will be a roving ff supporter . thanks .

NEU i 'm a bit worried about you lot ! you 're discussing running and the acshual race EMO_HAPPY group 7 have moved on from yesterdays discussion on marmite and why the b pings off my laptop to who needs a good spanking with my hairbursh and podds ' greyhound . not spanked with the greyhound . . . have we got the wrong idea ? ;--RRB-
NEU p.s. and yeah if a man who has only recently re-learned to walk can complete the marathon , i 've really got nothing to complain about !
POS hope you have a lovely easter too mrs s. have a good break from work . morning 7es . hope you 're all well .
POS well done marmite . what kind of structure have you got to your training at the moment ? well raced br and hilly . hh - good decision to call it if you were struggling , but i 'm a bit confused . you say you want to do 32 in a few weeks time , so as i can see it , your rep paces were pretty much spot on ? your rep times to race pace work out as 2000m = 31:55 / 10k , 1200m = 15:37 / 5k , 800m = 8:45 / 3k & 400m = 4:04 / 1500m . that to me looks about what you should be doing , rather than too fast , or have i missed something ? do n't forget it was quite warm y ` day as well , so that would have contributed to this feeling harder on top of the track session the day before . tr - hope the run went well . chin up . there 's still another 10 days . have you gotten it checked out ? try taking some calcium and magnesium supplements . they may help with the spasming . seriously . wtgy - well done on 3rd . laugh out loud @ ` was trying to remember what proper runners do to drop people ' - and what are you then if not a proper runner ? coro - i wore the adizero 's for the tt again yesterday . i think they are now my new favourite shoe . they just seem more conducive to faster running . they 're a little harder than the streaks , but that seems to suit me a bit better for faster stuff ... . legs were a little heavy this morning -LRB- unsurprising after fartlek on tuesday and a tt yesterday -RRB- , so with a 2 hour run coming up this pm i kept my recovery even more gentle than usual . as rb is not around to do his pace police bit , 6m @ 7:48 m/m . i think that is the slowest i 've run , outside of a cool-down all year ... i 'm starting to enjoy my little jogs as my second runs though .
NEU are you resting claire ??
NEU text run to 83040 . i think you get a return text with a link to a website where you put in the race number .
POS rat - do n't worry , everybody 's the same . this week i 've been having niggly niggles in just about every part of my body , and only today did i walk out of the house and feel that , yes , maybe my legs were , in fact , getting the benefits of the taper and starting to feel good and strong . by friday you 'll be bursting with energy and feeling 110 % fit . go for the massage by all means , but tell them it 's with the flm in mind .
POS great pics to nam . been thinking about tri for a while now but just cant get on with the swin front crawl last a couple of lenghts 20m pool and breaststroke takes about a hour for a mile dread to think about open water

NEU need some help and advice , please . have developed a ` pressure sore ' on my heel , at the top of the back of my shoe . what 's the best or quickest way to heal this ? i 've been running in these shoes for about two weeks and they seem fine , had n't given any sign of rubbing or problems . it was when i walked 5 miles in them that the agravation occurred , it was meant to be a sneaky way of getting the kids some exercise by walking them to their grandparents before running back for the car . i seem to have developed a habit for picking up injuries from non-running activities . any suggestions for a quick cure ? thanks .
NEU my oh has got in four entries in a row -LRB- although there were gaps between entries -RRB- .
POS jools , taper for edinburgh starts tomorrow , so 13 easy -LRB- ish -RRB- days now , unless i get carried away at wokingham next sun . mtr , good work on the 15 , particularly if it was in the rain i just about managed to avoid . that did not look much fun . br/hilly , now that sounds like a lovely run this morning . all the best for weds br . looking forward to hilly 's 100m race report . bang and there was the line , should cover it .
POS my god , the telly this evening must have been even more dull than usual , matt ! for what it 's worth i ran a 3 minute positive split , so perhaps 1.27 or thereabouts on a warm day is on the money . who knows . anyhow , in an effort to add a little more life and excitement into the thread , i present my hogweed trot race report . target was 40.15 . 40.26 was the score on the doors and either my pacing was abysmal , their mile markers were out or the wind and -LRB- from about mile 4 onwards -RRB- heavy rain had more of an effect than i realised . or two or more/all of the above . anyway , fwiw , splits were 6.22 , 6.47 , 6.17 , 6.40 , 6.14 , 6.42 , 1.24 . 3rd lady and a mug to match last year 's plate -LRB- also 3rd lady in 2008 -RRB- .

NEG as a dyslexia therapist i 'm not so hung up on spelling errors . . . running has felt quite tough this week . had to abort 2 speed sessions that makes me realise i ca n't do speedwork the week following a half marathon . i 'm just not recovering like i used to - sadly and as much as i do n't like to admit it , it must be to do with age !
NEU i used to have to leave at least a couple of hours otherwise i got stitch . for several of my lsrs over the winter i had nothing before going out other than liquids -LRB- sports drinks -RRB- - i 'm trying to get used to haveing at least a light brekkie before i go -LRB- just means getting up even earlier ! -RRB- . for daytime sessions i still leave 2-2 .5 hours if i can - prefer to feel 'em pty ' when i run . wel - just 4 away then ... ... !
POS burn those schedules and run free ! hopefully it 'll be nice and warm here early in the morning too - i like training when its stinking hot , but i need to be all done by 8:30 and i doubt it 'll be that warm by then .
POS i 'd just be interested to know . EMO_HAPPY
POS had n't really thought about this yet . i 've done 10 - 11 milers for the last 6 sundays , so i feel ok at the moment .
POS thanks mecca , much appreciated ! -LRB- its the only thing that keeps me going on those old wintery runs , knowing that i have to do it -RRB-
POS personally do n't think that going up to marathon training would be beyond you . i 'd take it if i were you .
POS and as a previous applicant they should send you one automatically .
NEG i ca n't seem to stop eating . whenever i can stay awake long enough . have n't seemed to gain any weight , but then not lost any . trouble i had last year was that after themarathon training deminished and weight started to gain ... only answer start training for this year . !!
POS that sounds good ht , maybe i should offer him a suck on my energy juice ?
POS can you make it about 7.15 . only these guys start at 7.30 sharp and do n't hang around for anyone.if you plan to get changed you might want to make it about 7.10 as there are changing facilities there.i 'll be changed already , i prefer to get home and showered . there is a courtesy charge of 50p per run ! i 'll chip in for both of us ... think i can afford it !
POS yes forget about carrying anything . listen to the crowd . last year i knew that khalid kannouchi and paula had won and that kk -LRB- not me i 'm kk -RRB- had set a world record , by actually talking to the crowd . plus talk to others round you , and say thank you to the waterstop people and the kids offering sweets and banana and it 's great . rythym you 'll be fine !!
NEU i know just what you mean tibby - i 'm following the runners world schedule to the letter t and its killing me watching my running pals -LRB- including my husband ! -RRB- doing longer and faster runs than me . but the tapering is recommended by experts with years of experience so who are we to argue ! last year after a weeks holiday and no running i ran the fastest 10k of my life so there 's something to be said for rested muscles . good luck .
NEG well not after you 've just peeled it off your sweaty foot anyway !
NEU hi guys . it was good to meet up before the start . i thought it was an excellent day - having my name on the shirt seemed a bit tacky at the start , but when my knee packed up at 19 miles it really helped everyone calling my name . . i thought the last seven miles was going to be a long walk to the finish , but i managed to slow jog and walk most of it , so i guess i should not be too disappointed with the time considering -LRB- even though i do feel a bit gutted -RRB- . next year !!
POS my sister did it last year and she is a huge 20 stone munter -LRB- exagerating maybe just a bit -RRB- it took her 7 1/2 hours , but she did it . it is a matter of the mind !!!
NEG help me ! ... i 've never done it before ! i 'm worried that i 'm not doing enough yet to get me thu it . . and i got ta get thru this !!

NEU my first too and i ca n't believe how fresh i felt . did n't have a dip and felt great all the way round , i actually went off a bit too slowly and so had tons of energy left for the last 5 miles , ended up running like the clappers to get under 4 hours - sorry if you were one of the people i barged out of the way !! . the congestion was a little frustrating to say the least and i think if i do another marathon it will be a quieter one , where i 'll see if i can improve on my time . missed the forumites at mile 18 but the rest of the crowds were great , not sure i 'd have been happy to stand in that weather for 4 + hours . text messages a `` bit !!!! '' disappointing too .
NEG ahhh , thinking back , i do n't think i did did i ? it was definately not in my bag anyway . what would it have been doing on my shoulder ?!
NEU hi all , can i play too ? i 'm looking at a nice long slow marathon some time next year , missed out on the long run this weekend as had a rather parenty weekend -LRB- both sets -RRB- but off to the gym tonight for the first time in over a month . got to get back into it !
NEG you are so cruel cougie ;-RRB-
NEU cc . & normski - hope you guys had a good run this morning . would have loved to join you but - stuck at work - boring !! cc are you still planning on doing the race on sunday ? did a really good session last night at arena 80 - 3 minutes running -LRB- fast as poss . then 1 minute stop and rest then three minutes back to where we started - did 3 reps. absolute killer - think i 'm comming down with a chest cold - noooooooo !! apparently some peeps are starting to get responses from flm - ca n't breath so excited have asked my other half to let me know if there is any post for me - ac n't wait until i get home . emma have you had any news yet ??
POS hi nemo , hi all . nemo , you 're doing well . apart from a long run at weekends i 'm only managing one other in midweek but at least i 'm doing a long one . i 'm in the nikelondon race on sunday night , wave 3 . look out for me i 'll be in a bright yellow long sleeve t-shirt EMO_HAPPY
NEG did n't do my race today - it was cancelled because of the ice :-LRB- -LRB- -LRB- . i got mr debbo to let me out of the car on the way to his mum 's and i did 4 miles along back roads in fife instead . i think it 's time to relax and read some of my christmas books now !
NEU thanks for that - i will probably still arrive too early ! i am one those people who get hung up on time - i hate being late for anything , so i usually end up being far too early .
NEU it 's also possible that you are more tired mid week due to work etc whereas you are more rested by a sunday morning . although you had a tough 2nd long run you will probably gain from it as you ran when you felt tired , quite a valuable exercise for marathon training !
POS hippo - you really didnt taste the sprouts at all . . it was really nice . i have a smoothie maker but i dont know if it would cope with the veggies ??
POS do n't know what you 're fretting about greg . you ran a half marathon at 10:08 per mile . well , i 'm 5 years younger than you , have been running three years , and would kill to be able to do that pace for 13 miles . believe me , a bit of anxiety is not just understandable , it 's actually pretty healthy . if you were n't having any doubts you 'd be unique . what you do n't yet understand is that the day itself , the occasion , and the crowds , will make your heart twice as big as it feels now . just you wait and see . honest greg , you 're doing just fine . best of luck . andy .
POS janee2 well done , very good time . . reading sounds as though it was a busy half , so loads of folks to run alongside , good experience for london .

NEU no help to you now , but next year , apply for the gold bond even before the ballot . then ifyou get a ballot place you just let the charity have the gold bomnd back . i thought the alzheimers peeps had some left ?????
NEG i 've taken a few days off from training , i feel as guilty as hell for missing my long run , but i 'm sure i 'll feel worse if i ca n't run on the big day .
POS fifidella - like you say not a great course but it gives you an idea of what it 's like to run with a lot of other people . great time by the way anything about 1:55 for the half calculates to 4:00 for the marathon !!! but you can never tell until the day . i did 1:44 last year in the same race and ended up finishing london in 4:30 due to a calf strain at 16 miles . hoping to improve on that this year though ...
POS hi - thanks to all who responded to my comments placed last week - i receive notifications but somehow i can not read your responses - shame as some of the help and advise that i have read sounds to be good . finished silverstone in 2hrs 4mins , improvement of 4 mins on last year - on target at 10miles and even ran with the 9min mile pacer - but from 11 miles seemed to be treading water ... ... missed a number of mile markers so really please when i saw the 13mile marker and managed sprint to line . 20miles in morecambe next week trimpell - so hoping for a 3hr 30min target . will try the flapjack refueling instead of lucazade to see if that aids . well done everyone - keep going - not long to go now . and again apologies for not being able to read your responses . will keep reading the posted comments for ideas and help . take care
NEG i have not trained last week & missed 4 hours of midweek training runs , missed what would have been my 2nd 1/2 marathon distance this last sunday & as yet i still not been able to train this week because of a pulled thigh muscle , this sunday should be a 16-18 . what do i do as my training prog stipulates that after this weekend i should start tapering off & at present it 's not looking good for this weekend let alone light training runs this week ??
POS panties kids were in the bar post flm . they were indeed angelic . i will be there . might not make sense tho . might be nissed

NEG i 'm dreading that idiot on the train sneezing over me and giving me his germs . yuck .
POS tallguy - do n't beat yourself up about it . competing while under the weather is always difficult so sub-2 hours with a bug is not bad at all . welcome back sweep . it 's a shame about your injury a while back but atleast you 've been sensible and have set a lower target that should be more achievable . there 's so many of us with knee injuries on here . prohibition e - is tonight the night when you 're allowing yourself a drink ? open water swimming is n't that scary as long as you 're really slow like me . in last years firth of forth race i had a canoe next to me from about 500m into the race as myself and one other guy were bringing up the rear way adrift of the rest of the masses . it 's a great challenge you should give one a try sometime . just read about your 10k , those km markings were shocking . you may have run a sub-45 race already . cheers for now . ppb .
NEG hi all , just when i had put my thermals away coz the warmer weather had set in i watch the forecast and they tell me there 's gon na be snow by the weekend ! it 's no wonder we 've all had colds , flu , viruses , etc , etc. the wind direction changed suddenly today and the temp dropped 1 or 2 degrees straight away . on top of that i 've now joined the injury list with a severe pain on the ball of my left foot right at the base of my middle toe . feels like i 'm walking on a stone all the time . if anyone has anything similar and a remedy i 'd be grateful . . kattysparke , i 'll be getting to the expo for registration about 11.30 on 13th , comig up from east grinstead . will be travelling up from three bridges on 17th if anyone else travelling up from south wants to meet up . despite injuries and ailments i 'm staying positive about the day and really looking forward to it now . good to see zimchick and paul made the rw column . p.s i know somewhere that hires out walking sticks and zimmers should we require them on the day !!!!
NEU was your number 666 ?
POS hello all , i 'm back !!! um - i 've emailed meldy , thanks for tracking me down . can t have my email working on this site as it s a work address so i probably shouldn t really be on these forums ;--RRB- . showboat , sorry to hear about your problems , have you definitely decided if you re running this year or not ? i hope this thread has been of some help to you and maybe you could use it as inspiration for next year . i felt awful having to defer last year but it 's been worth it in the end as i m feeling pretty good now . how s everyone else doing ? hope you 're all tapering nicely without any problems . . it felt so weird on sunday only doing an hour s run . this week i ve got a 40-50 min . run tomorrow , gym session on wednesday and my final pre-race run on friday . going for a gentle 20-30 mins . back over the scrubs where my training really started last year . i m going to the expo on friday and will try and get there as early as poss . to avoid the rush of out-of-towners . on the other hand i may be so excited that i ll go after work on thursday - so impatient ! sorry not to be able to meet up with you shuffler at the expo and not sure if we ll see each other on the day . you re a bit faster than me but it s nice to think of you and sezz being on the same team as me . i ve decided to set myself tasks for each day this week to keep the nerves at bay . today 's task is writing and sending off the last of my letters asking for sponsorship . it s a bit late but you never know . i ve found emailing and writing to people direct has been quite effective , nearly everybody has sponsored me and some people have been surprisingly generous . total is somewhere around 700 excluding gift aid and my company will add another 250 in a money match scheme so it s looking quite healthy . must go before this email turns into an essay ! 5 days to go !

POS hi fb - thanks for that . yes , i 'm really looking forward to mb . i 'm not much of a climber at all , but did an intro week in the alps last year , and mt aspiring in nz at christmas . i 'm going with a climbing company in august . did you travel off your own bat ?
POS wp , . thanks . i have n't made up my mind where in canada i ` llbe making my home but i 'll be resident there for a while . i head off the middle of may . rfj has a picture on his lfm story and i 'm right behind him . i have n't found any other pics of the gang . alanm , is there one of you doing your interview ?
NEG it 's easy to jump to the wrong conclusions -LRB- as i did -RRB- - it 's been pointed out to me that some runners and marshals sell their medals and jackets , t shirts , caps , jackets etc and donate the proceeds to charity - a club colleague of mine is donating whatever he can get for his staff medal to the dreams come true charity . good for him -LRB- but yah boo to any one who is profiting for themselves -RRB- .
NEG thanks for the stats , wardi . hmmm , there certainly does n't seem to be any logic at all , especially if the men 's qualifying time remains unchanged , despite there being far more men achieving it . this would mean that i 'd have to train even harder to get my qualifying time at berlin in september ;--LRB-
NEU if done correctly , the reason that you gain weight is because you are storing extra glycogen - and glycogen requires water , thus the additional weight gain , which will be drawn upon very quickly through the race . this is also part of the reason you may feel sluggish and heavy at the beginning of the marathon but really good around 10-12 miles , as you have already burnt up some of your stored fuel and are already lighter . even if you already run off less carbs than you should , you would still benefit from this , as you are trying to encourage your muscles to store more glycogen than normal . there are a few ways of carbo depletion/loading , and one of the common ways of doing it is to have 3 days of lower carbs -LRB- i actually take this to extreme -RRB- and then do a 3 minute run flat out -LRB- after a good warm up -RRB- and then 24 hours of eating a very high carb and low protein/fat diet - so in fact , the 6 days fall very clearly into focus on protein/fat for 3 days , 1 day of very high carbs , and 2 days of normal eating . this is less likely to make you feel bloated at the start line . normally , the distance runner 's diet consists of around65-70 % carbs , 15-20 % protein and the balance fat . in the carb load week , the first 3 days will look more like the atkins diet - loads of protein , then fat , and finally carbs . you will know whether you have done it correctly as on day 3 of the depletion , you will probably feel like the lightest you have ever been - most of this is water loss . it 's really important that in the carb phase on day 4 you eat the right amount of carbs , otherwise you will not load sufficiently . as a 56kg woman who normally eats 65 % carb diet , this means that in those 24 hours , i will eat roughly 600g of carbs . i wo n't overeat calorie consumption . that equates to around 2400 cals of carbs . . i have done this as a veggie and it is a lot harder to do it than eating meat . it also is pretty hard if you have a sweet tooth ! but it works .
NEU or maybe even working ???
POS legless - thanks . very small field last year was n't it ? that might put me off - do n't really want to be last ! will see how my running goes over the next few weeks . had a lovely relaxing time in your pub yesterday . wanted to get out to lunch but somewhere where i do n't come across people i have barred everywhere i look . your place was ideal .

POS judging my your post i think you need a bit better finger control with that rubber one ! i 've not tried a rubber one but i do have a black one here at work ! ;--RRB- its actually a bit sticky at the moment too ! shirl , the week after next i will be expecting even more out of you . practise makes perfect , well done x
POS where do you all find the time ??!!?
NEU we let ladies in our group as well morticia - although they have to be voted in by the ` thread ' team and there are certain attributes that they must have . you are more than welcome to make a guest appearance ... -LRB- despite not being voted in . . -RRB-
NEG well done to everyone who managed their long runs in the bad weather this weekend . i struggled through 12 slow , wet and muddy miles . the cold bath at the end of it all did n't seem as cold as last week as i was frozen right through already !
NEU bedders , do n't apologise for wearing different colour specs from me . i 've done this race three times , and the start has been delayed each time . very annoying - i 'm with you there . . i 've just found that the positives outweigh the negatives , that 's all . we tend to major on ` organisation ' when we assess races , and of course that 's important , but there are other factors to think about . yes , i remember that there were complaints about the buses but i 've always driven there and have n't experienced that myself . the race itself feels like a big event which is why i think it 's good preparation for london -LRB- insofar as anything can prepare you for london -RRB- . bottled water , energy drinks , big field , tons of marshals , good crowd support , town centre running , finish in a high-profile stadium ... i 've never had any trouble getting my medal or buying a teeshirt . the thing about reading is i think they genuinely try to improve the event year on year . they keep switching the route and the date to try to improve it , and i respect that .
NEU some fantastic mileage being run out there , keep it up guys . just got back from my 20 -LRB- ended up doing 22 -RRB- very windy on the way back - bit of sleet thrown in for good measure ! managed the run in 2 hours and 56 minutes , probably a bit fast , but felt ok . i used some gels for the first time - sis orange flavour . reminded my of sweet semolina , yum yum - not . seemed to keep me going though , so i think i 'll stick with 'em . i bought a specific waist belt to carry them in , nice and slim , did n't even notice it on the run ! need to practice getting them out though , nearly ran into a telegraph pole whilst trying to get one out - doh !! enjoy your sunday evenings - hm .
NEG work means i only manage 3 runs a week ... 2 midweek of 7/8/9 miles and then a long run on a sunday . i 'm up to 16 miles now and doing 18 tomorrow . it 's the midweek runs that are hard . this week my 8 miler was b. ... y hard work . every step was an effort , every hill was like everest . i did 15 last sunday steady in 2hr 20min . can i still do 3hr 50min ?? i 'm beginning to doubt it . need some encouragement or some advice on how to train smarter !!
POS forgot to say - . get well soon tootie ! and if there 's coffee going free in hopkinton then count me in !
NEU pinks - well done at milton keynes , i was there too , was my first 1/2 m. i must admit i found the wind around the lake very difficult to run in , makes you feel like you are n't going anywhere . at least the weather was alot better than predicted . good luck everyone at silverstone and liverpool .
NEU who got the biggest pb yesterday , i know mr simmons whacked 9 minutes off anybody on here beat that ? ***** the stockport harriers how much did they shave off their half marathon pb going off their own watch chart ***** . gingerbreadman 7 seconds . witgb 25 seconds
POS itc - could n't agree more . i never dreampt of even competing in a marathon 6 months ago ... so getting to the end will be one hell of an achievment i know . i seem to have caught the running bug , so i hope that i will continue running way past april 23rd ... thanks for the inspiration .
NEU a convent somewhere up a nepalise mountain .
NEG think my feet/ankles have had enough of marathon training , did a fast ` ish 6 miles last night and hobling around on a new injury today , right ankle , ca n't really pinpoint it , just sore walking on it , that alone running ! not doing anything till 20 mile oakly race on sunday , and hope for the best . i do n't think i 'm designed for marathons , but i 'm determined to get round somehow ?
POS andrew , i agree with karen and jej - run the half at mp -LRB- but you have to be sure that you wo n't end up racing -RRB- . i ran a half at marathon heart rate 2 weeks before london last year and it was a real morale booster for me because it demonstrated that my target time was acheivable .
NEU hi everyone , . sounds like we are all on a high . hope everyone 's last lsr was a good ` un . did an 18 miler yesterday , just missed the major downpours . walked the first half cos of knee problem , then the second half i tried the pose method of running just to see . it was a miracle , no knee pain at all and i was doing 10 min miles ... i 've never run that fast ever ! went back to my normal running style as an experiment for 1 min and knee instantly hurt again . so i 'm sticking with this method for london . can anyone recommend so ok tasting energy gels ? tried the sis ones and they were disgusting . they had n't been anywhere near an orange and the consistency was what i can only imagine eating frog spawn would be like ! ok i have a vivid imagination . well done everyone on your hard work so far and enjoy the taper weeks .
POS aa - nice job . great run hm very impressive , . well fdone on all the long runs peeps . you all seem to be cruising in to the taper modes , not quite sure if peeekay is though ... ... ... i think he may need to consider a taper or 2 ... take care folks
NEU my running number is 13611 ! maybe i will see you there ! not dressing up - i 'm going to struggle getting round as it is . i am running for breast cancer campaign . i was thinking about wearing a bra over my shirt ?!? argh ... so close now !
POS busy week at work , but now demob ` ed till after flm . spending the next week visiting family in the south-west , so i might not get connected to the intermeweb for a while . run well people . thanks for the support and camaraderie . keep smilin ' and be proud .
POS easy ... easy ... easy
NEU defo for shorts . it 'll be very warm in the crowds . bike style shorts for people worried about chafing and lots of bodyglide ... t shirt or vest top only too ...
NEU did the flm in 2003 and loved it - or rather loved finishing it - said never again and had changed my mind by the following wednesday . anyway , after 2 years of rejections -LRB- nice watch and a huge rainjacket -RRB- i was accepted for this year , and got on with my training . although i have been quite enthusiastic and the training has been ok , i must admit that it was n't the same as the first time - i just did n't seem to have the same sense of excitement , which i guess is understandable as i 'd wanted to run the marathon since i 'd first seen the early races on tv . a good example is that last time i pretty much lived on this forum , whereas this time i was just dropping in and out -LRB- and consequently missed the support group stuff - must pay more attention -RRB- . anyway , this week the nerves have hit me big time , and i 'm really struggling to focus on anything else . i 'm trying to be excited as well , but , to be honest am a bit all over the place , and ca n't really think of much else at the moment . any non-virgins experienced out there experienced this ? best of luck to all of you , watch out for me in my welsh flag running vest
POS last post before the big day , as i have an early start in the morning . can not belive we have nearly reached the end of this long journey . the training has been great -LRB- except for the first two weeks of taper -RRB- . have meet some great people during training , and have been surprised by how generous people can be when you push a sponsor form under their nose . also the number of people who have stopped me and wished me luck . not forgetting what a great time i have had reading and adding to this thread over the last five months . have really enjoyed reading your comments , cant wait to read the stories next week . good luck to you all hope you all achive what you deserve from your hard work and most of all enjoy the day !
POS i have only just seen this message ! i was there this year !
POS ran my hm at a hilly watford . so i agree a soft target . re abingdon . i was n't going to bother with trying for a sub 3 , as it has never really been a goal of mine , but i 'll do it just for you , to make you happy .
NEU the future father in law is desperate to get my folks to ` dish the dirt ' ... good lord . we are having an italy paty here tonight cos the boys are all coming round for the football and one of mr kp 's mates grandparents are itailan . tenous but there you are .
POS dn - thanks for the words of encouragement . i suppose that i do n't count my 3 '08 vienna effort in the same light as the other marafuns as my target was 3 '06 as opposed to sub 3 for the ` others ' . i am very pleased with my negative splits for vienna though . 20 mins running on grass for me last night ... oh the long road to recovery !
POS manage another 2.2 today once i got out the dor . veyr nice , and once my mind was numbed to toe pain , i enjoyed run , any day now even downhill was not too bad ! will try 4 tomorrow , me thinks ! hoping to get up to 9 by sunday . leicester definitely on now ! claire - make sure you recuperate well ! weight : before rhm i was 12 st 3 , after -LRB- and after a fair bit of rehydrtaion -RRB- i was 11st 12 . now i seem to have got back to 12 st 5 . concluson : extra 2 lbs of muscle ! ;--RRB- . -LRB- ca n't possibly have overdone refuelling ! -RRB-
POS brilliant nicks - well done , you have really come back stronger after being so poorly ! no way i will be able to keep up with you come flm 2007 ! lol . rio , i 'm confused ... how do i know what i did wrong last year ? and how did you know it was the long runs ? i did couple of 16s , couple 18s and a 20 for this year . i just felt tired on the start line and felt grotty around 10-16 miles but after that i felt better and could have run a lot more but just did n't really get going again .
NEU ms raptor , best wishes for abingdon . i did my now weekly 13.1 mile solo run yesterday , and was slightly peeved that my pacing -LRB- without technology -RRB- was marginally off and my time was 1hour 47 and not 1:43:30 like last weeks . i guess i 've gotten used to always improving my times , but for a training run , i should be happy that it 's now a regular thing and not a monumental challenge anymore . the plan for glen clova half is to collar someone of experience who has a bleepy thing so i can attack the 100 mins target ! pidge , your photo did n't do you justice either . i had you down as a white van man in his forties ! anyway good luck with barnes green . it should n't be too hot for you ! find someone beforehand who plans a similar pace to you and smash your pb when those gazelle genes kick in from mile 10 onwards !! just do n't bring up your job if you like a chat going round ! ha ! ha ! i am gon na experiment with these wee sis gels that mr dap swears by at glen clova , if it can give me a wee boost to maintain my pace . hrr , i have big plans for you in the winter months ahead , so soak your feet in vinegar like a pair of conkers , and fingers crossed you 'll be back soon . . amanda z , hullo . good luck in stroud . think i 've been there when i lived in bristol . take it easy and think only of good things , never giving negative thoughts any space in your head . . i 've not looked at any training plans yet , feeling that the higher my long run can be come christmas , the better . i 'll have less ground to make up in 2007 , so might actually enjoy it , instead of it being the most hellish 12 or 15 weeks of my life ! qq , does the bloke off blues clues on nick jnr still sing the bedtime business song at 7pm ? a classic ! may have asked this before , but if i 'm 6 ft , 13 stone and have run maybe 500-600 miles this year , is it ok to wait for santa to bring me a new pair of 10 n a halfs ?
NEG given they claim to automatically mail out marathon news to those previously rejected i have a bad feeling about my 5-times-rejected application this year - they 've only mailed it out for past 2 years , had to go looking for it before then . have cheques stubs & bank statements available , plus list of the `` thanks for bequeathing '' gifts - 4 of which are still in use . have never found the helpline all that helpful ; maybe i just get folk who are having a bad day ... ?
NEG hi all -LRB- changing subject -RRB- . totally gutted today as actually dropped out of my 5k race after 1k . started strong then unbelievably right hamstring cramped out ... pretty much out of the blue . i stopped and stretched it , started up again , but it hurt like * $ ! ~ so i stopped . now i wonder whether i could have kept going ? was the seizing psychological ? because it does n't feel so bad now ? . first time i 've even started a race and dropped out . what a horrible feeling , but i guess it 's all part of being a runner . . in general i think i 'm putting too much mental pressure on myself over race results . which is silly , because it 's not like i 'm even at elite level as an amateur . from now on i think i might start thinking of races as training runs with a bit of company . . i also think i need to race more so that each one does n't seem like such a big deal . anyway ... really disappointed , so if anyone 's got any good jokes or anything ??
NEG good advice to take a mobile with you - mine plays mp3 's and i know i can always use it to call a taxi in case if injury - keep the volume low or you ca n't hear the traffic . . wear something reflective so you can be seen - even with streetlights it amazing how invisible you are without hi-viz gear . and remember , other people are probably more scared of you than you are of them - imagine how you would feel if you were out at night -LRB- walking -RRB- and heard the sound of someone running towards you . the worst i 've had is being egged by a goup of teenage morons from a car ; i was heckled by a group of adolescents once but asked them to run to the top of the hill with me - as you can guess , they all dropped out exhuasted after a couple of hundred yards !!
NEG i 've yet to hit an easy patch in a marathon ! hippo 's spot on with her advice as usual . my big mistake in my first mara was not having carbo loaded enough and i ran out of fuel too early . not pleasant !
NEG hippo - ouch - hope you 're ok - call a doctor ?
NEG sf is roobarbs partner -LRB- at work only -RRB- . ot ehrwise kbown as spannerb1tchbumfface
NEU happy new year all ! thanks for the comments , bambina and kayvee . my back is still not quite right . no pain anymore , but just feels uncomfortable under my right shoulder - like a muscle is trapped or knotted or something . think i will give my old physio a shout - better to get it sorted out sooner rather than later ! i 've been off running for the last couple of days anyway - my first hangover of 2007 has reached a second day of suffering !!! read more in my flm training blog at : .
NEG darren , i will also be looking for 1:35 at wokingham and will see if 1:30 is possible at fleet or reading , to push for 1:30 may not be a good idea at this early stage in training . wokingham is a good fast course , last year was windy , very wet and cold so you should not have too many problems , just after the start i would suggest to stay on the path , if it 's been raining and if running on the grass could be a bad move , it 's not too long before gaps start to appear and can then settle into your pace
NEG managed to get up early this morning to get speed session out of the way . 4 x 1 mile at 15.5 km/h with 2 mins rec . found it very difficult especially the hill i have to run up on the way back from the gym !
NEU reb mm - just want to reinforce what the others are saying . when i did my first marathon training , i ran too soon after having a chest infection and ended up with pneumonia . i ran because i did n't want to put a dent in my training , but ended up writing myself off for weeks afterwards . . that said , i still managed to catch up . you 've still got plenty of weeks to slowly build up the long runs , especially if you 're not going for a particular time . in many ways , your first marathon gives you that extra bit of freedom that you 're going to get a personal best regardless ! good luck .
NEG i reckon i was approaching wall state , actually . more of a garden boundary sized wall , but the pace definitely dipped at the end as i climbed the final hills . sorry . remember , i 'm an aspirant still , not an achiever yet .
NEG typical that i mistype the word that is bold , so it stands out !
POS aorn , i hope you 're out there blasting away your hangover now ! good news on your shin , qq :o-RRB- . gentle 5-miler for me this morning too , to find out whether i could run in my new sorbothane insoles . they were fine . i 'm not a morning runner and never really warmed up , but my shin did n't make too much fuss .
POS tr sounds like you 're aiming to beat my bramley time . i do n't think i would recommend racing 20 miles as i did . i managed it because i was already well-conditioned -LRB- 2x 20 milers in jan and 2 x 22 in feb before bramley for example -RRB- .
NEG i did a 10 mile race on sunday - 71 mins . i am a bit concerned about the number of long runs people have done . i have been following a rw schedule for sub 3.30 and have only done 1 x 15 and 1 x 18 . i do have 2 x 20 and 1 x 22 and 2 x 15 before 22/4 . hope this is ok . i am still not cofident of being able to do 8mm for lm - 7.10 for 10 miles was ok but couldnt do it for any more 13m . . getting worried again .
POS morning everyone . i have posted this before on another thread -LRB- sorry rio -RRB- but thought it might be of interest to you . `` word to the wise '' for those who are treading the roads of london for the first time . . on race day just think legs . what ! i hear you say . think about it . you get out of bed , you have to travel to the start . you may well have had to take the train . you have to walk from the station to the start area . now your nervous and you are walking around looking for friends or charity areas . you go to the loo , and stand in a queue . you have a coffee still standing you change and then at last you go to your start pen . what !!! sill 30 minutes to go and your still standing . yippeee the gun goes of . hang on you havent moved . it could take anything up to 10 minutes before you actualy cross the start line . then you have to run 26.2 so the moral of the story is keep off your feet as much as possible on race day . take an old shirt , jacket , bin bag , anything to sit on wherever you can . if you dont you will wish you had . trust me i learnt the hard way good luck everyone enjoy your day .
POS hi all . just popped by to say i am in no way jealous of you lot doing the flm ... not at all ... not even a bit ... no sir ... not on your nelly ... face ? bovvered ? ... am i bovvered ? not bothered at all ... honestly , really
NEG caro its not that sort of a massage . if you are in pain it is just to take some of the knots out of your legs and not relaxing at all . stiffness is all part of the marathon unfortunately - it really does hurt a lot . and it cant be avoided . some grit and determination is needed . roz some people carry deep heat with them to rub in when it gets tough or the muscles cramp too much . might be worth thinking about rather than adding an extra layer .
POS howdy ! i went to the gym again and my foot is still holding up . going to try and run for a little longer on it tomorrow morning to see how i get on . fingers crossed ! hope mrs ps get 's better soon ! tracey , tell bernard well done from me -LRB- although through gritted teeth ` cos hippo 's right , it just is n't fair !! -RRB- . lyndy , good news from you - let 's hope you 're well and truly on the mend .
NEU show off ! ;--RRB-
NEU morning all , . tr - you 've got to rest up , you are only delaying the recovery . geewok-fingers crossed ... at least you know what the problem is now . ww-i 'm planning on doing the 13 miler as a progression run starting off at around 7.30 's and winding up -LRB- the last 5 mile -RRB- at projected mp . dan - whats the plan ? ... 6.20 's
NEG ws i 'm not sure that mile 1 reading is correct as my hrm has been playing up a bit and i wonder if it got confused with other hrm 's and telly signals etc. the first mile was v slow so i think it could be wrong . having said that , my hr was definitely shooting up when i was still in the queue for a wee with 4 mins to go before the start !
NEU more like 65 for the cd this time wd
NEG i , like others have already said , ran with my own 500 ml bottle at the start , when empty i discarded the bottle but kept the sports valve lid . and just screwed it onto the next bottle i got . i was able to do 2 stations per bottle , but still found there was nothing at 11 thru 15 then only intermittent supply to the end . im not sure whose fault it is . i suspect it 's 6 of one and half a dozen of the other . flm should have put more on , but likewise faster runners perhaps should have bene limited in the amount they can take . i dunno . . i aint pointing fingers . . guess in a sense it adds to the `` challenge '' of it all . :--RRB- .
NEG i did a silly thing with my 305 and set mine to marathon distance -LRB- i only bought it 2 days beforehand ! -RRB- and is shut off at 26.2 miles , with 4 minutes to go . up till then it was running about a half-mile extra . . it says garmin can be up to 99 % + accurate but given the several tunnels we had to go through , canary wharf and isle of dogs , etc , not surprised people are out by so much . i 'd rather it was telling me i was slower than actual , than faster than actual . looking forward to using the training programmes from this site with it , once i 've recovered .
NEU laugh out loud tr my legs look more like 2 sticks of celery poking out of a carrier bag :--RRB- . swim was in some school pool really wierd as you do 8 lengths 2 per lane then get out and do 8 more . carnege for shite swimmers like me . nice running jakesy . i was out at 4am this morning for 10.4 miles at 7.36 pace . not fast or hard but nterestingly my avghr was only 129
POS i forgot to add london chest hospital 10k - 8.7.7 to my list . am hopefully taking a group of brownies to the 1 mile fun run on the same day . am going to chat to them about my marathon run and having lost lots of weight -LRB- although the emphasis will be on being healthy and not losing weight . -RRB-
NEU < pushes the door open one last time ... > . hi minni - i ran 3:14 at lochaber , which was a pb by 11mins . i use my hrm on every run , although the battery packed up during the marathon itself -LRB- typical ! -RRB- . windsurfin ' susie over on the hard training thread has far more technical hrm training knowledge that i do , so it might be worth sticking your head in there . for me , i religiously kept the vast majority of my runs to 70 % of my working heart rate / 75 % hrmax . i now know what the different efforts feel like and do n't need to check my watch very often . hrm training has certainly improved my sense of pacing . almost always i run by effort and by time on feet , not pace . so for example , my tempo runs include , say , 30mins at 1/2m effort rather than a 1/2m speed . and a typical long run will be something like 2hr30min at 70 % whr , rather than an exact mileage . this approach allowed me to ramp up my mileage to 70-80mpw at peak without injury/overtraining . i ran every day for over 6 months from last september until the taper without problems -LRB- having spent the preceeding 18 weeks off injured and not running at all -RRB- . in the last 4-6 weeks of training i made the switch over to quicker running , trying to hit specific paces , increasing the speed on long runs etc. . which brought me nicely to a peak . i reckon the best thing about an hrm though is on recovery days , where it gives you permission to run slow -LRB- as slow as 10m/m , sometimes even slower -RRB- . i 'm a complete convert to ` active recovery ' now , rather than taking rest days . it 's all useful mileage ! my average pace during the whole training period was only 8.48 m/m . very little speed work at all . but despite this , my eventual marathon pace averaged 7.26 m/m with a slight - ve split . and my 1/2m and 10k times came also improved . hrm training takes patience though . . initially most people have to slow right down and that can be hard psychologically . so it 's not everyone 's idea of fun . but if you 're going to give it a go , i reckon spring/summer 's the perfect time to do it ! a good intro book is ` heart rate monitor training for the compleat idiot ' by john l parker . < closes door on way out >
POS mike-you posted a few pages back a recommended schedule -LRB- post marathon -RRB- to keep things going before the next marathon training block -LRB- autumn -RRB- . seems to have vanished , any chance of posting it again . cheers .
NEU gobi youda man . without the skinny one with the funny gait to hold you back you 're bound to nail it . have a good weekend kids . as you were then .
POS glad its not just mine susan - maybe howard will help us out with some of his wise words .
POS ah , that ceilidh was rocking . do you know it finished 2 ish ! yes a few did the whole thing and mara at then end too ! i think k2 and loon dod both did the lot!i went back to bed at a bout 10 though i felt so miserable , lets just say as well as wooden left leg i had totm and was sitting at the meal struggling to talk , smile or anything . best at home when i feel like that i think ! hubby is number 68 , following me in on the beach run , i am carrying our mates camera because they both thought it a good idea to jump into the sea before we finished ! it is a fun event the beach one , you have to guess your time and the nearest to it wins . one of our friends got it spot on and i was +35 secs !
NEG oh dear not a good last few hours for bw today and nn yesterday afternoon . i would say i hope you kicked his ass bw , but does n't sound like you 'd want to put your foot there . hope the weekend gets better for you two , i 'm sure the theraputic running helps . ca n't complain other than being at work . a few hours to kill then off to beverley races and no ` silver ring ' or ` tatts ' for me today , i get to lord it up with owners and trainers for the afternoon , what-what . leaving the running to the horses today at least . hopefully harvest warrior will do us proud again and make it two wins in two , though i 'm not sure if the ground is soft enough - this horse is more x-country than road race .
NEG i 'm an all the gear cyclist so if i am out i do n't really care about the weather . . i know when doing tri , my running never got worse while i was cycling and running less . i have noticed this year that although i do little or no cycling i can still manage 19-20mph for an hour on the bike and then get off and run . . downside is my bum hurts due to lack of riding !!!!!
NEG oh my god look at rh and i 's forum posts !! what a couple of wasters we are ! tee hee . managed 45 mins on saturday . bit fed up as it was incredibly hard work . i just ca n't seem to get back into it at the moment . hey ho ... i guess body is not quite there so i 'll continue to cross train ahead of my hols ... just over a week to go !! excited ? me ? never .
NEU oh gatton no you do n't have to do that ! pinks i 'd like to do it in 2.5 hours . i 'm not sure that 's realistic though .
POS just repeated last saturdays 20 miler on my loop . i came out about a minute slower overall spread through the 3 sections . very happy with this one and a great way to bring up the 100 mile week . racing -LRB- easy plod -RRB- around the downlands 30 miler tomorrow i will not be rushing .
NEU a comment was made about not having a gb charity place the first time you do the marathon . i disagree as people really see it a challenge the first time you do it and appreciate that it is really something hard that you have never done before . because of this i found people quite willing to sponsor me . i 'm not sure that i would get the same response if i did it again as they would know that i had completed it once . i had a fundraising target of 1500 . i managed to raise 2,200 . i did start fundraising in december with a christmas raffle and did a few other activities as well as asking for sponsorship . the company where i work also gave me some sponsorship . it can be done , you just have to be willing to ask a lot of people !
NEU what did you expect it to do ?
NEU cheers ah & susan for kind words . . good thing was when i got back to my car there was an ice-cream parked opposite . :p . spring mara for me ? does n't appeal to be honest as spent so much of this year training . might go back to 10ks etc. had lady at club on wednesday chasing me for this years x-country . even thought of gsr at the moment is not attractive . better flippin get that sub 4 at budapest or i will be doing another one wo n't i ! . right as if not had enough punishment for one day now off to get legs waxed - ouch ! EMO_HAPPY
NEG : -LRB- sad , bored delia today . i 've had to call in sick . got no voice , ca n't swallow , ca n't eat , ca n't breathe very well ... yuk yuk yuk . got the quacks in a bit but i 'm already bored out of my tiny mind !
NEG unfortunately odeon , 2:59 is n't that impressive for a wheelchair athlete .
NEG ww - sorry about removing you ! on the training plan , i was n't suggesting that would be it for the week , they are just the key sessions i reckon . on the mp training , some of the medium-long run might be at mp and some of the ends of the long runs . i 've never done much mp training , because i find your options are : do 5-6m at mp in a longer run -LRB- which is basically what i suggested above -RRB- . do 10-12m at mp . i find this really hard and can barely manage it without entering a hm race . i usually do this a few weeks before the marathon e.g 5m easy warm-up , straight into the hm at mp . i do n't want to start a fight , but i 'm not a fan of running at mp in training !
POS tell him you promise not to run whilst you 're in the pub . sorted .
NEG hi all . bootsie - i hope your leg feels better soon , i know its easy to say ` try not to rush it ' , but in your mind the event gets nearer . maybe some long walks , will ease you back into it . . topsec - i can imagine how annoyed you feel about flm losing your entry , i was very lucky this year , i know , and of course i would have accepted rejection , but losing the so many entires seems very careless indeed !! . ran 5 miles this evening , the first 3 went pretty well , but my legs then felt very heavy , did 51.47 , but the 8 miler on sunday will be much slower pace .
NEU p.s. nice cartoon in the december edition of prospect magazine i thought some of you on here who share my ` anti-fat and the population is being seduced by food and car manufacturers ' views might enjoy : . a stout man is seated at a desk in shirt and tie . on the desk is a sign bearing the legend ` immigration ' . on the other side is a thin man , at whose feet are several suitcases . the text below the picture says : ` you 're in luck ; we 're very short of thin people ' .
POS some great long runs going on . i wish our county xc was on the saturday so i could have bagged one but never mind . had a reasonably good race , came in 8th , but given the opposition i could n't have come any higher up , and would have been very disappointed to come any lower down . there was about a 30s gap in front and behind me , which enabled me to enjoy the last lap a bit more . it was probably the hardest course i 've ever run on - i reckon i was n't faster than 10min/mile up one particular hill , and it was n't that short , and we had to do it three times ! three main hills on each lap , and very muddy for about 50 % of the lap . think we just lost out to coro 's team for the win , but did n't hang around to find out . anyway , a good workout , and i 've been offered a place in the team for the intercounties , so a good afternoon out all in all . coro and edb probably had more interesting races , so i 'll let them recount their tales . ed in particular had a pretty ` eventful ' run ! marders - i 'll be at the fred hughes 10 , but marshalling -LRB- we host the race -RRB- . i think jej said he would be doing it , but that was a while back so may have changed .
NEG last night at the track we did a session -LRB- into the wind of course -RRB- of 10 x 3 mins , with 1 min recovery , quite a tough little session and it definitely made me puff and blow : - o. this morning was a 6 mile run into work on the icey pavements and road , which was an adventure . i was skidding and skating all over and had to head for the grass verge to stay upright on a few occasions , so forgot the time and concentrated on making it in one piece . tomorrow is a rest day , as i have a league xc race at whitby on sunday - feel cold just thinking about it !
NEU i 'm going to do the hotel switch today . mind you lot sound as though you 'll be miles ahead
NEU i do n't think it is cheating really , if you run against the virtual runner on the watch is that not smilar to a pace maker which most top distance races have these days anyway ?
NEG wardi - just pops in to say i too found the wind just a tad much today . i could cope with running into the wind and hardly moving , it was being dragged up a hill by the force of the gales near a main road and having no control over my legs !!!!!!! cut short my run after 6 miles too . hope it 's calmed down for my 20 miler on sunday . enjoy your weekend and your rest day in particular !
POS hello boys and girls ... lots of good running going on and lots of good banter - who are all of you people anyway ??! just got back in from my trip to the smoke - had a good run this morning from pimlico to birdcage walk and the mall - raised my hand s in victory as i crossed the finish line . . 6.30 in the morning and no-one was looking ... ran towards trafalgar sq , took a left to run along the embankment but got lost and ended up in birdcage walk again and ran past the finish line again ... . then found the river and finished off my 7.5 miles . just 2 observations - it 's very very flat !! well at least compared to up north . and secondly , nobody says hello to you when they run . . again very different from up here . looking forward to the snow in a few days - that ; ll stuff the training ...
NEG ohamd , . not any better . i was going to go out today as the weather was so good in the midlands , but as it was cold and i still have the sniffles and a cough , i decided not to risk it . if i had , i know i would have been out of action for another week or so . it seems to take ages to get rid of a cold when you get older . i think the plan for the next week is out of the window and when i can get back running , it will just be getting some miles in . . hope the rest of you keep away from the colds etc. .
NEU ltsa - i think you are spot on , about not getting injured , but pushing you just enough ... ... and of course enjoying the run !! are you used to running that pace ? cause i will need someone to keep me on track , although i will have my trusty -LRB- mostly -RRB- , garmin 305 with me !!
NEU take some tissues and try not to make your ` issues ' the main thing on your mind all the time relax and hopefully enjoy ... it is a beautifull day today for running ...
NEU great run benyo - it sounds lovely down there ... ... ... i managed my 16 miles - at least 8 or 9 miles were straight into the teeth of the wind . however , i did n't feel as bad as i thought i would even though uphill into the wind is n't my favourite occupation ! completed in 2hrs 20min so i was really quite pleased as its a hilly route . now i 'm shattered though , so i 'm laid on the couch watching the rugby . . something strange has happend to my left foot ! along the outside edge at the bottom it has developed a big red/black bruise during my run ! did n't hurt as i ran and does n't hurt now ... ... ... anyone any ideas ? i know i 'm overdue for new shoes but keep putting it off as these are like an old pair of slippers now . hope you all enjoy the rest of the weekend - i 'm routing for your mum benyo ... ...
POS hail hail . confess to preferring the 1 hour stint option -LRB- purely cos i aint got the reall speed in my legs , but stamina i 'm ok -RRB- , but i 'll defer to the majority opinion . . nts - quick question . i 've been looking at flights . due to family commitments , it would be better for me to get a friday morning flight down . is this going to be a big problem , if i 'm not there for the start ? i 'd prefer to be in all the photos obviously , but is it crucial ?
POS laugh out loud tt my kid brother is 27 this year !!!!!!! took 5 miles to catch you at wokingham :--RRB- . tr , as usual i would say something different to the others and suggest you did a progressive run with only about 6 miles late on at planned mp but thats just me . 6 @ 7.15-7 .30 . 6 @ 7-7 .15 . 6 @ planned mp . 2 easy . if you can run between 2.15 and 2.25 with relative ease you will be able to run a sub 3 marathon .
NEU evening everyone . . did llanelli today ... madwelsh it was nice to meet you too . sorry we did n't get much time to chat but i guess after a hard race is n't the best time anyway . i was feeling really nauseous at that point . EMO_HAPPY that 's the second time i 've felt sick after a hm . has anyone else experienced that ? my hm pb is 219 but i only managed 2:25 today which , actually , on the back of all the hard work we 've been doing lately , is n't that bad i guess . it was really windy too . the training must be paying off though because i 'm not as stiff and sore as when i did lake vyrnwy half ... shame they 're not doing that this year ... tis a lovely race . sd that vid made me all emotional too ! . as for all the niggles , i 've a few that come and go . i 've suffered with pf for ages now but it only seems to affect me when i 've been inactive for a while , it does n't stop me running . it band ... i 'm aware of it but as soon as i get a twinge -LRB- and this goes for all my other niggles -RRB- i have a sports massage ... i 'm covered in bruises but they seem to do the trick ! good look for the coming week everyone ...
NEG brian , . very short term plan is to get out of work as early as possible today - 9pm finish on tuesday , wednesday and thursday has left me cream-crackered ! and i need to go to the gym as only exercise this week has been 2 x 5 miles @ 7.35 m/m , which is hardly top-end stuff ... in terms of training , plan is to introduce some short and fairly gentle speedwork next week , so that my 3 runs of 5/6 miles each week are something approaching quality work and to do longer , lower hr sessions in the gym . then i 'll test the waters with either a 10k or a leg of the midlands road relays the first weekend in april and take it from there . i 'm probably being over-cautious -LRB- gobi would be proud ! -RRB- but having been in pain even walking for 10 days i 'm scared of pushing things now . better safe than sorry and all that .
POS geoff m - just read back that you are starting at blue start . think you may be a bit quick for me tho ' ! i 'm going to try and find the sub 4.30 pace maker and stick like glue ! how about you will you pace youself ? EMO_HAPPY
NEU thanks wa . < wanders off to find thread to add own angst >
NEU hi everybody . good to see you are all doing well keep it up . had quite a hectic week so ive only managed a 4 mile hill session at gym on tuesday and two 7 miler on friday and today but ill just keep plodding on . busy at work next week we have the cheltenham gold cup races going on at our hotel lots of irish spending there hard earned cash on the horses , ill see if i can get any good tips off them . i purchase some new trainers back in jan and ive now done 180mile in them does anybody think i should get some more now ready for april . take cake all . mark
POS gd - just replied to your thread , yep he was going quickly ! and , yes ... i 'm sure that last mile was at least two . . EMO_HAPPY
NEU lardarse - are those your legs ? to the question do they look like women 's legs ? my answer is have you met my wife ? you seem to have a thing for shiny medals ! tutu - hopefully swimming and long taper will get rid of whatever it is you have before doctor gets round to finding it . eastham - it was susan who asked if you were lardarse not me . lardarse is on fetch so i know he is not you , and you are n't him
NEG picked up a calf niggle on last night 's run , . was still hoping to do tonight 's planned track session but after a gentle 4 mile warm up it was feeling worse not better so decided to skip it . do n't think it 's anything too serious , just a bit of tightness -LRB- i hope ? -RRB- , probably caused by the faster-than-normal 20 miler on sunday . not long to go now tr . i 've just about had enough of the high volume and endless long runs too . quite looking forward to having a few easy weeks after flm then targeting something shorter .
POS thanks for the pics lep recorn , i think it looks like there could still be enough room -LRB- though we have to bear in mind other members of the public will need to be able to get past us -RRB- ? . what does anyone else think ?
NEG hi , . this is my first post so go easy . i 've been training for the flm -LRB- my first marathon -RRB- since december and looking for a sub 3:30 as i have stuck to my weekly garmin training for that time . this week is supposed to be my hardest week -LRB- 56 miles -RRB- , with a 22 miler run this weekend . however , i have picked up a couple of minor injuries and dont know what to do . . first injury : - i have recently been getting knee pains , which i think is runners knee . i have tried to keep my training up , only missing a few short runs so far . i have also started running with a knee starp which helps until i finish when i get a bit of pain . second injury : - i 'm not sure what this injury is but dont think it relates to my training , i 've had it before some time ago . it 's a pain in the arch of my foot when i 'm walking , it 's not bad at the moment but i 'm guessing that it might get worse an end up as a sharp pain in the arch . the irritating thing about this is that i brought it on today when i went shopping with some new trainers on -LRB- not running trainers -RRB- . i have spoke to other people about this -LRB- non runners too -RRB- and they also say they have had it from new shoes \ trainers . i was hoping that while i taper my running over the next few weeks my injuries would get better but dont want to stop training yet if i can help it . any suggestions ? thanks
POS actually friday would be ideal - the relatives might appear on saturday ...
NEU loach
POS ode - so does this mean that you 're officially fit ? good stuff ! gobi - this treadmill with a view over the alps - not in the shiny new -LRB- ish -RRB- town centre gym by any chance ? next to the rowing machines looking out over a gently sloping chair lift ? EMO_HAPPY . gah ! another list that billy-no-maramates here does n't qualify for . sod it , i 'll do me own ! philpub start : champs elysees halfway : 1:21 - ish prediction : sub 2:45 . * sets tt as virtual running partner on the garmin ... *
POS nn , i think we should be at the expo for around 2pm friday -LRB- by the time we go to hotel , dump our stuff and get round to excel -RRB- . i will e-mail you my mobile number , so you can ring/text me when you get there . i may go for a massage too and have a look around . you 're welcome to come to my hotel for shower afterwards if you like , have you tried booking in there ? they may still have rooms available and have let us keep the rooms on for the last 5 years , so it 's a good bet they will this year too , porridge in the morning too ! . i 've wound down so much , i think i 've gone into ` sleep ' mode . as you were all doing 10 milers at marathon pace yesterday , i was doing 5k in the road relays , so quite a difference ! went out for 3 miles at mp this morning before work and tomorrow night is another track session -LRB- 6 x 400m @ 6 min pace -RRB- , 6 on wednesday morning @ mp and 10 x 200m strides on thursday , then 2 days rest . think i 've been a little too laid back during the taper period !!! EMO_HAPPY . nick , my race plan is to start off at 8.15-8 .20 pace and then pick it up at 14-15 if feeling good by then -LRB- and weather permitting -RRB- . at least we found a good bush for going to the toilet at the green start , no way i 'm queueing for toilets , there just are n't enough and when you got ta go , you got ta go . puffy , hope the shins are feeling better and not as tender . beders , that damn hamstring ! i blame those creme eggs myself ! i 'm sure you can keep it under control with some icing and careful training this week , enough to get you round flm before it gets properly sorted anyway . ls , some grim happenings in your area , not nice , but i guess it can happen anywhere . good to see you are still breezing along -LRB- in your lycra leotard -RRB- , so now i know what to look out for on sunday !!! we will be at the hotel from around 5pm when we get back from the expo on friday , what time do you get there ? euph , temp . certainly plumetted yesterday & you 'll be glad that you did n't run the northern relays . the men ran legs 7-12 in a blizzard and could hardly see where they were going ! luckily most of the ladies teams had finished by the time the snow really came down in golf-ball sized flakes . i ran the 4th leg over 5k in a time of 20.58 on a bumpy course , so quite pleased with that in my ` warm-down ' week . our team was 13th from 33 in 1.57 , so qualified for the national road relays . clairster , will meet you at the expo around 2 -LRB- ish -RRB- on friday , will text you EMO_HAPPY . moggie , you 'll be flying along as usual from the elite start , it must be great to start at 9am and get away ahead of the crowds - good luck , although you do n't need it ! womble , great long run , knew you 'd be fine ! roll on copenhagen EMO_HAPPY . cp , great new pb , that must feel good !! well done EMO_HAPPY
NEG oh bugger , the phone 's ringing .
POS team - you have important mail ! blimey ... it 's all a bit close now !
NEG that was a very sleepless night ! . not sure i fancy this porridge . .
POS its my intention to achieve a gfa time in the next twelve months . i have various half ironman distance triathlons until september and then intend to try and put the training time into running over the winter period , crack the gfa -LRB- 3.15 time as i am now 40 -RRB- early next year and then concentrate on triathlons again knowing i can enter flm or ny etc without the hassle of ballots
NEG i have a hang over today ... first since my birthday on 2nd january . cant cope with them these days - back on the wagon tonight ... we just had a couple of friends round for a takeaway curry and there was some champers left from people bringing it over post flm and so i set out to drink it . . and then some wine when it was finished ... had a heated argument about ken vs boris for london mayor and woke up feeling like s *** e. EMO_HAPPY
POS marders . you never know with me about the 6mms : ~ -RRB- but i can confirm that tom is not my brother but the similarity has been noticed . padams . rach says well done to you .
NEU bej - good to hear it 's clearing up . i 'd hazard a guess that your 'em barassingly slow ' pace is still quicker than anything i 'm doing ;--RRB-
NEG tony , 5-1 , and mcallister who attended the game spent the second half on the bog crapping himself . all being well i shall be at wembley , wearing my askern 10m , 2006 teeshirt -LRB- 62:01 , second m55 -RRB- . ld : the regents park run i refered to was round the outside , albeit the uphill anticlockwise route . other london parks i 've run round include st james , hyde , green , battersey , richmond , bushey , ravenscourt , paddington rec , , primrose hill , hampstead heath , hainault woods , wimbledon common , ruislip woods and ealing common ... oh and wormwood scrubs . and one two weeks ago , whose name i forget ... best wishes from south lincolnshire where we do n't have parks .
POS rb - think i 'll be up for sat evening food and you 've got some knowledge of decent places to go i would imagine . however , it will be me plus 3 -LRB- girlfriend also running the marathon , and parents , not running ! -RRB- - assuming they 're all welcome . good to hear the course is reasonably sheltered , although they 've changed their mind now and reduced the wind slightly but it 's coming from the other direction ! dull - you must be reasonably pleased with that if it was n't a full-on effort . ` race ' report from me - 30th in 36:50 ish -LRB- 19 minute first 5k and 17:50 ish second 5k -RRB- . very pleased with my restraint , which was helped by running with a clubmate also doing edinburgh . it was fun flying past people in the last km ! obviously i 'm not able to disclose coro 's result ...
NEG daz , you forgot about the all venomous critters -LRB- scorpions , snakes , etc , -RRB- out there . i 'd leave that one to bear grylls ; he likes eating scorpions for breakfast . sandstorms , too . and it gets bloody cold at night .
POS happy birthday ltsa !!! . had a brilliant day yesterday and managed a pb !!! completed the half marathon in 2 hrs and 15 mins !!!! very proud of myself . . my relay partner did it in 2 hrs flat on her first race !!! so overall i think we were done in 4 hrs 15 for the whole marathon ! i saw shades going around and she looked tired but doing great EMO_HAPPY very very hot day there and some hills that got the better of me -LRB- hills to me anyway !!! -RRB- but most fun race i 've done and very proud to do it at home !
NEG intervals today which i was a bit sceptical about , one mile wu/cd with 3 x 1.5 around bushey park , with 0.5 recoveries . 10:37 , 10:40 , 10:39 for the 1.5 's , quite hard work by the third one but got through it ok . the hr was up to around 83-84 , so still a bit lower effort than i should be putting in for interval , but although sore , the leg and foot were fine throughout which was the main thing .
NEG wt - will be thinking of you today . i spoke at my sister ' funeral . i knew i could n't not , and although tough to do , it helped to have happy moments to talk about , and made getting through the day more bearable . i hope you can help give her the send-off she deserved .
NEU hail hail . why am i not surprised .
NEG same here sb.i think yesterday 's heat surprised a few people , even up here . i did a 10k and found it hard work , then straight to pj 's football match where we found a kid 's triathlon taking place with a cycle course across our pitch . so off to the opposition 's pitch where we got beat 3-1 including a robinsonesque howler from pj . liverpool failed to beat stoke ; chelsea failed to beat man u. after all that , the 10k results were up and on top of being 2 seconds slower than my last race on my watch , they have got me down as 20 seconds slower than my watch time . on the positive-macc half next week , followed by congleton the week after .
NEG multiple x-posts for me -LRB- must be really slow -RRB- . brian - nice track session . have to say not looking forward to the 20 on a weekday . -LRB- i probably wo n't be able to start until 7:00 pm as well EMO_HAPPY -RRB- . mtr - sorry to hear the not so good track session . rm - bugger , good luck with the new mission
NEG it 's tricky is n't it ?
NEU tt - my best opportunity to have run a mara would have been 2005 -LRB- i know it 's not `` when i were a lad '' , but it 's still long enough ago for me to get misty eyed about it -RRB- . i 'd had 3 months at 90 + mpw , an hm of 79:05 , but no long runs over 18m so i reckon i would have breezed it to 20m , thereafter i 'm not sure . now i 've got several dodgy bits that just ca n't cope with the pounding - to the extent that yesterdays 15m has given reason for concern . my september stats are . miles 238 . ave pace 7:14 . max week : 57 miles . min week : 52 miles . rest days : 0 . races : 1 . wins : 1 - well sort of , if you exclude the 21 under 60 's in front of me .
NEG just read back . congrats and commiserations in equal measures all round . . sorry for not posting but i 've been a bit busy and now have a cold .
POS lol , thomas will be very toasty . the baby jogger has a muff and a rain cover too . not sure about the pb though ha ha EMO_HAPPY . good luck hippo with your 10k .
NEU erm ... . .
NEG sorry blisters , the head won ! our road was an ice rink but once you got onto the more main roads it was fine , so i might have to put this down as a missed opportunity . suffice to say that 20 minutes on a bike this morning and various parts of me feel as though they 're about to fall off with the cold .
POS on the subject of projecting mara times off half-m 's - i do know of a couple of ladies who have broken 3:15 -LRB- only just -RRB- off a half time of 1:31 / 1:32 . i do n't know of any blokes that have done it however which rather re-inforces my theory that girlies are slightly better suited to long distance running . the simple fact is that the quicker you can run your half-m 's , 10 mile races etc then the more comfortable sub 7:25 pace will feel on marathon day . i tend to do 8 or 9 20 + mile runs in the build up , the 5 longest usually add up to about 110 miles . i have found the midweek ` mid ' long runs of 11-15 miles have also improved my performances in the last couple of years . in line with ex-pat 's thinking , i try not to do 20 mile runs on consecutive weekends if at all possible . lorenzo . my 3:18 in 2000 was the last time i failed to break 3:15 . being only 3 mins adrift should give you confidence aplenty to have a good go at it next time . . 11.5 m run home last night . about 9m with the club tonight .
POS intervals - done ! actually really quite enjoyed them . how bizarre . the poxy hrm is bonkers though , i think it worked at the start , then gave it up . maybe because its scared of the readings ? anyway , the vital statistics , for those who so like them go a little something like this : . distance : 4.36 m. time : 42:16 . pace : 9.40 mi . average hr : 122bpm EMO_HAPPY . our easy bits came in at about 11mi , our intervals 8.35 mi , except for the last one , which was up hill and so was 9.3 mi . not bad ! now i need a serious dunk in a hot bath . will try not to fall asleep and drown .
POS does anyone know if there 's somewhere to find out what time you predicted for yourself ? i ca n't remember at all whether i said 3.30 or 3.45 . . or do i just need to wait and see which pen they 've allocated me to ? -LRB- i never thought for a moment that i 'd actually get in through the ballot , but now i 've got a place i 've committed publicly to trying to get 3.30 !! -RRB-
NEG i am following the 3:45 schedule too om but not so rigorously , i am doing lsr , the two longer midweek runs , plus one run with our group , usually a thursday , which is usually 4 or 5 intervals of around a mile and a half but there is dedicated speed session and a hill session too in rotation but i find i have to hold back a little or i get overtired . and i ususally miss the saturday run . so it could be argued that i 'm not really following it at all really ! just back from 7 miles in an easy hour , and off for a shin-saving cold shower before a meal and dvd with mrs puffy .
NEU br , you are a 34.0 x machine mate nice . jock , great run mate . race report today . 8th place oxford mail league cross country . learned this year that i am not that slow so have started going off a lot harder , settled in around 15th place -LRB- always a few flamers on the 1st lap -RRB- moved up a few places and started the 2nd lap just around the top10 and racing 2 chaps . working well we all took another place and then i got ahead of the 3 . worked the climb and headed out onto lap 3 with a small gap in 8th place . pushed hard into the wind to try to force a gap -LRB- gave myself a stitch -RRB- . it worked well and i recovered in the trees and headed for home . all in all a good run and the best bit , my knees feel fine !!!! worst part about todays xc was all the ribbing about the picture and article in runners world . even people who do n't always talk that much ribbed us both .
NEU sarah what a great run today ... you must be pleased to get that out of the way with a lot of us doing our lsr 's tommorrow . great time as well . i aiming to be at 18 at 2hrs 50 on the day so you are storming it !! keep it up . hardly any snow in hull this week so managed 3 shorter road runs and now getting focused for a 16 miler tommorrow morning ... . but its freezing cold outside already and forecast for minus 2 first thing . cant say i am looking forward to the first 2 or 3 miles . skins on the radiator tonight ! emily can you send any nec routes to me ... . i am there at a show at the end of feb and need an excuse to escape the bar and to down a third or fourth sparkling mineral water . . god it can be boring sometimes being a runner . had some second thoughts about the ` sub 4.20 ' on the back of my top ... as i am worried i might not achieve this on the day ... but have decided to go for it anyway as i am confident jagman will locate me and carry me to the end if my pace is too slow !! off for a big bowl of noodles ... hopefully catch up tommorrow .
NEG ode : . good to catch up yesterday . i managed a few more afterwards and ended up with 15 at just under 7:15 pace for the lot . was tooooo cold towars the end though when the proper snow was starting to fall . legs like blocks of ice when i 'd done . wo n't be there this wednesday btw , but time and venue is the same , you 'll get a warm up getting there which is good as last time they went pretty much straigh tin to 5 x5 minutes on the old railway line . off to do an interval session with my club shortly . pug : you coming out to the half on sunday regardless or only if you get a number ?
NEU icclesuez - hello ! EMO_HAPPY just cross posted across you , sorry . well done on the race . which one did you do and how did it go ?
POS in a nts style , i spent the flight back from lisbon doing some hr/pace analysis . using the fetch beats/mile calculation as a good basis , and eliminating runs under 8 miles to reduce the effect of the early miles and low hr -LRB- plus it strips out all the interval sessions -RRB- . i then set a baseline of the first quarter of 2007 -LRB- when i was training for my 1st marathon , and bought an hrm -RRB- . i came up with the following stats : . 2007 . q1 100 % . q2 94 % . q3 92 % . q4 88 % . 2008 . q1 86 % . q2 87 % . q3 88 % . q4 85 % . 2009 . q1 84 % . which is broadly what i expected . steady improvement until march 2008 , then a dip in fitness with london , post-london and the summer , then a return to form in the autumn . quite surprised to see that i 'm apparently running faster for less effort than a year ago - but this quarter is n't done yet , and the margin is quite slight . 16 % improvement in pace/hr implies something like 1:20 mm pace improvement at easy pace -LRB- from 8:30 to 7:10 -RRB- and from 7:20 hm pace to about 6:10 pace .
POS nice runs bramley boys . just waiting to hear from marders now i think ... although i 'm prepared to be impressed . marmite - wow , great time . all the sweeter for having had to work so hard to hang in there with the group . hard the first time but now that you have broken through to a new level it will get easier and easier . i wanted to run the tumbridge wells hm today -LRB- kent champs -RRB- but could n't as it filled surprisingly quickly . instead i ended up making a longer trip to dover to run a hm there instead with a long w/u and c/d to make just shy of 19m . an annoyingly hilly second half with a strong head wind made for a very tough slow return . did about 36.30 to half-way and then struggled into the wind to come home in 76.54 . clearly all the fast runners were at tw because my time happened to net me the win ! first time for everything ... but pleasing given the time in the saddle yesterday . now where 's my pug - ometer . 78m for the week plus just shy of 5 hours swimming and cycling . keep em coming .
POS ok , here is the original plan for this week : . week 7 -LRB- how did it get to week 7 already ? :-LRB- -RRB- . sun - rest . mon -- choose an undulating route so that hills are naturally included into the run . aim to run for 50-60 mins with 5 x 5 mins @ threshold built in . this is best run as 5 min easy/5 min threshold repeated throughout . try to include the hills naturally but cut the pace and maintain the effort when running up hill . let yourself go downhill . . tues -- rest -LRB- but i 'm going to do monday 's run here and rest on monday instead -RRB- . wed -- pilates as normal . thurs -- group run of 60 mins with the first 30 easy and the last 30 @ marathon pace . . fri -- rest . sat -- 2 hours 20 mins all controlled and relaxed . except i 've got the bourton 10k on sunday , and i 'm not sure just yet how its going to fit in . more when i 've spoken to nick ...
POS hi all . roger , very sound advice everyone should follow . i 've done the last 3 flms -LRB- taking a break this year but will be back in 2010 -RRB- with advice from people on this forum thread and its been invaluable . half the training is in your mind so i love your run to work and home again suggestion . even though i only live 4 miles from work -LRB- 3 on the short cut -RRB- i ca n't usually run in as i have to take my boy to school first ... but this week is half term so i may well give it a go ! not long to go now then dave ... do you know its a boy ? i 'll guess at a girl and 8lb 12 . good going caro . i had a busy weekend but did 10k before breakfast on saturday morning and 4 miles at 6.30 today !
NEG ` it 's cold outside , no kind of atmosphere , we 're all alone ... '
NEG help , my toenails feel like they are going to fall off - does anyone know what i can do to ease the pain ? the two toes next to my big toe are really sore from the run on sunday , they are not totally black , but sort of brownish and very sore to touch . i have plasters on them to try and cushion from the top of my shoes , but am so worried they are going to drop off . last nights run was agony , not just the toe nails but my heel as well , and i had to keep stopping to stretch out very tight calves . i do n't think my ` free ' sports massage did much good .
NEG ff ... if its any consolation -LRB- hope i spelt that right mum of ff -RRB- i had a foot injury this time last year and couldnt put any weight on it . rested it for a couple of days and all was fine . rest but dont panic !!! wotsit ... probably shouldnt mention it on here but loving your thread ;--RRB- i too am shattered . trouble is non-running friends and family have no sympathy and come up with helpful sugestions such as ` take a couple of weeks off ' . ah bless em . ttl ... nothing nicer at this stage of the training plan than 2 speed sessions a week !!!!!! sezz ... belated thanks for the advice . have managed to find a local practicioner from the link you sent . . now just need to book it !!!
POS thanks wotsit , it 's good to know nick 's thoughts and that you and tb are doing something similar . i know i should have faith as the schedule seems to have been good so far .
NEU nice one tr . easy does it now . rb - gutted for you but glad the little one is ok . dinner sounds fab . very jealous . fancy a jog round with mtr , brian , tr and myself in a few weeks . just over 20 for me this morning . after a day spent plastering yesterday i was achy as buggery this morning and not looking forward to another load this afternoon . still glad , i resisted temptation to go out . i , too was gloves , 2 tops -LRB- hh +1 -RRB- , shorts though as i 'm not gay and loads of people out in vests . unless it 's 2007 temps , i 'll be wearing gloves on the 26th .
POS yes a good thing - the endurance phase is pretty much over now - you have done all the really hard stuff and now can just focus on feeling sharper and getting some speed back into your legs . rest up , stay healthy and look forward to the next 3 weeks and running the best marathon of your life
NEG x-post ant . two bits of advice : . 1 . if ` quad is a bit tight and sensitive when i crouch or sit on my haunches ' - do n't ;--RRB- . 2 . more seriously , be very careful with anti-inflammatories . mate had injury in lead up to flm07 and was taking anti 's daily . got to about 23miles and up came all the lucozade , and blood , and he ` lost ' an hour in st johns ambulance . lots of tests afterwards found no damage other than temporary thinning of stomach lining but to the anti-inflam 's . all the best . jezza

POS hi all - just got back from the expo . it was great - bit of hassle getting there - its so far the ` other side ' of london for me . it started with ` the london marathon music ' as you walked in - so that puts you in the right mood and slightly emotional ! . the registration was painless and actually took about a minute as there was no-one in my queue . . lots of different nutrition stands giving out samples - bit late to change your race nutrition now - but there were some interesting stuff like gel cubes which look like jelly cubes and sort of melt in the mouth and each cube held the same carb value as one gel . they come in packs of 5 and are really compact - god i sound like i work for them . lol . look out for them ... lots of charity stalls , and clothing stuff . and if you go to the pasta party then you do hear some interesting stuff ... although i think the price is a little steep ... and you can hear the same thing if you just stand and watch outside the area . my sister wrote a huge good luck wish for me on the adidas wall which was really sweet . oh it was all fun ... and has made it feel even more exciting and scarily close . yikes . . lots of freebies - bottle of cranberry sauce in the goody bag which is a little odd . . free beer stand as well - but no use for me in my no alcohol regimen that i am strictly adhering to ! . i hope you all it enjoy as much as i did EMO_HAPPY
NEG sj , 167 is not 85 % of 188 . metcheck says heavy rain for the duration . . coro , i had a stinker yesterday too .

NEG on the recovery side of things pfitzinger and douglas are very strong about not rushing back : . ` you have little to gain by rushing back into training , and your risk of injury is exceptionally high at this point , owing to the reduced resiliency of your muscles and connective tissue after the marathon . the -LRB- recovery -RRB- schedule starts with 2 days off from running , which is the bare minimum of time away from running you should allow yourself . if you still have acute soreness or tightness so severe that it will alter your form , or if you just do n't feel like running , certainly feel free to take more than 2 days off . if ever there was a time to lose your marathoner 's mind-set , the week after your goal race is it . . not running now will increase your chances of being inspired to resume hard training when your body allows it . of course , some people do n't consider themselves real runners unless they run pretty much every day of their lives . plod through a few miles if you must , but be aware that you 're prolonging your recovery . ' -LRB- p169 -RRB- . p & d do go on to advocate light cross-training such as swimming or cycling and walking .

NEU h - how far ?
NEG 1/2 marathon race this sunday . not sure if i 'm looking forward to it or not .

NEG woony , i think eddie was talking about me . i tend to plod behind and looked close to death after 13 last saturday ! sitting here i 'd love to do 18 but will prob change my mind whilst running , especially with those hills .
POS well six of one , half a dozen of the other . i did say that the pace for the get you round group needs to be about about 12 min miles . which if you then take a time based training schedule would give the distance !! in last years ` get you round '' john `` the penquin '' bingham came in at 5hrs 36mins which is approx 12min 45secs / mile
POS this is a great thread and i 'm so glad that im not going totally crazy and that the flm is consuming other people lives as well ! between the marathon dreams , working out mileage , worrying about every little ache or pain , thinking about my blisters etc. . it 's a wonder i can fit the training ! good luck to everyone
NEG if the times were only 15 minutes slower than the men 's qualifying times then there just would n't be enough women qualifying . sad but true . . i seem to remember that the championship women 's qualifying time used to be 3 hours but was dropped in fairly recent years due to the lack of women qualifying . i 've even known the odd woman get a championship place when she has n't got 3.15 but just over and this never happens for the men . in 2000 there were approx 6,000 women in total running the flm compared to 24,000 men ! the same goes for the women championship places going off with the elite rather than starting behind them . there 's only about 100 at the start of the women 's race in total . whereas there are hundreds of championship male entrants . . rm -LRB- hoping to qualify this year for the sub 3.45 guaranteed future entry time -RRB- .
NEU i was out all last week feeling rough - got back into it on monday doing 12 miles , so i would say you 'd be ok

POS had a good 21.5 miles in 2:57 , so feeling good for the day now . one more long run next week , then ease up at last .
POS i will when i move to stourbridge , they sound really friendly . unfortunately , the cardiff club was too fast for me , and think that 12 min miles is walking !
NEG i really ca n't see something like this being a target . ca n't think of any precedents for attacks on sporting events like this . hardly likely to win any sympathy for their cause .
NEG this is the site but i think you will be too late for a gold bond place , there was a deadline for the entries .

POS yeah ... ... ... ... ... ... . . !!!!!!!
POS thanks for the info guys - very helpful . i seem to be the only one of us going from the red start - i guess i will be somewhere around the rw pacer as well . good luck
POS if you have name on front and back run on outside of the main runners the crowd will see you and give you that pick me up you may need , down themall last year the crowd lifted me of my feet and glided me across the line , it rearly does help
NEU thanks for your advice - i 've decided to scrap any notion of doing the diet . i was dreading having to do it anyway . sine i had a bad marathon experience the first time , i just seem to be looking for ways to get through more comfortably the final 5/6 miles when you enter the ` unknown ' . but probably the best thing as has been said is to take it easy the first half of the race .
NEU yes , but not too soon . would like to do dublin , but also want each marathon to be my best shot and train well . it has to fit into your life and other commitments . personally do n't want to fall into trap of ` collecting ' marathons , underperforming and picking up long term overuse injuries which then have a habit of reappearing . my immediate goals are improving 10k and 1/2m times this year .
POS jim , i am nervous for all of you lot ... if i do n't see you again jim , good luck and enjoy EMO_HAPPY
POS morning snoopy !
NEU hard luck . i blew up at the 16 mile mark last year . but that was because of a lack of training ! it took me 2 and a half hours to do the last 10 miles . well done anyway , though . you still beat my pb by over 15 mins . bb . p.s. did you drink enough ?
NEU ali . i was the ` other ' get you round pacer yesterday . i split from john at mile 16 -LRB- deliberately ! -RRB- to carry on at approx 12 min/mile pace while he dropped back . . i finished in 5:27 from the gun . john did n't have a good day and walked in the last few miles .
POS well done everyone . i was doing ok till about 15miles then slowed dramatically . finished in 4.42.54 according to my watch but flm site showed 4.57 last night which i reckon was my gun time . i did n't enjoy it as much as last year but i think that was a combination of the heat and subconcious pressure on myself to go sub 4.30 . still , i finished and i can walk today and even the stairs are n't too much of a challenge ! see you all next year ?
NEG batfink , that pit bull passed me as well , lead and all.i was looking for his championchip .
POS for some reason i just thought it would be really funny if paula were to run next year 's london marathon in a womble suit or something . the look on ndereba 's face as she gets beaten by three minutes by a womble would be hilarious . so - what costumer should paula wear ?
POS it felt great to me , but that was because my wife and several friends were in the grandstand . once i 'd spotted them and seen my wife holding a camera to her face , i suddenly managed to run faster -LRB- even sprint , or that 's what it felt like -RRB- . i do n't remember the noise , particularly , but it was a great moment !
NEU show-offs the pair of you !

POS i seem to remember overhearing someone on the lucozade stand at the marathon expo saying that the drink handed out during the marathon was slightly different from the stuff you buy in the shops - they had made it slightly less sweet to make it easier to take in . can anyone confirm this ?
NEU i do n't think i 'll be able to time it that close -LRB- especially if it 's as warm as it was this year -RRB- . . just hope to be able to pass big ben and be confidant that the clock will be 3:29:59 or less when finishing ...
POS i would never had started without the ` get you round ' run/walk principle . it works !! in this group you are doing for yourselves , not against the clock . you find you do it for others in the same boat around you !! go for it .
NEU will have a look tonight an let you know - nathan just lent about 15 dvd 's to his friend in bristol though so may have a sparse selection ! i have geri yoga if you 'd like to borrow that !

NEG i like doing speed sessions on the tready too - as has been said it pushes you . had my longest run last night , 15 miles , absolute sh1te . the previous long run was 13.5 and i could easily have done another 3 , last night i blew up at 11 and shuffled the last mile in around 11 minutes , which for me is very slow . bollox . hopefully just a temporary set back .

POS last night was +12 miles at 6 ' 55 '' pace . felt great not to be plodding . i know what you all mean about city / country running . i 'm moving to a house right at the end of the gnr . you can run along the edge of the cliffs -LRB- national trust land -RRB- from south shields along to sunderland and then come back over the hills and countryside of cleadon -LRB- past safc 's academy -RRB- . nothing better than running in the early morning in the summer EMO_HAPPY
NEU i am taking a weekend off this week , kind of scheduled . i am a bit nervous about it but i think it is going to benefit me . i am away in edinburgh . hopefully come back fresher next week ! . really struggling to convince myself to go out tonight at the moment though !
NEG i 've toyed with gettin getting involved with the epping forest running club . but . my problem with running with other people is that i have 2 babies and kind of run when i get windows , so i 'm pretty unreliable when it comes to arrangments . i guess i could find maps if i was n't so lazy
NEG things are n't looking good at the moment . my knee pain is getting a bit worse and i 'm now feeling it after a shorter period of time . i started to feel a bit of pain after just 5 or 6 miles of last nights easy 9.5 miles . i 'll see what happens in my long run this weekend -LRB- 21 miles -RRB- but if it goes badly i may be forced to give up on long runs and just stick with training no longer than 2 hours . i 'll then just `` chance it '' on marathon day . not exactly how i had wanted to prepare .
POS . 1.48 for a half . bed now . goodnight all .
POS andy , have a look at this article on peak performance , they have some interesting stuff to say about tapering . i reckon you should definitely cut your mileage , your body needs a chance to build up glycogen stocks . some of their `` neural training '' workouts could be worth trying . the mantra seems to be `` cut volume , maintain intensity ''
NEU cheers taffy - i 'll check with them and see what the official cut off is . as it stands i would be happy just to run round but i do n't really want to start walking - partly because if the knee is still bad even that could put me out for months . i 've only got a few hundred quid in sponsorship - probably would have got to about 3 or 400 in the end .
POS is her exercise video any good ? if so i 'll get my wife a copy . i 'll have to watch it too of course .
NEU water stops are wet , lucozade stopes are very sticky ! try not to step on bottles of water as you will tuen an ankle - also beware step-squashing lucozade pouches and squirting it up other peoples legs is funny until you tread on one that has had top put back on !

NEG not great news this to put it mildly , particularly as i received an email from runners world just a week or so ago , confirming the event would go ahead and you were just confirming dates - not impressed .
NEU ran a 17 miler today with my new rubbery but orangey tasting camelpack ... ... the question is ... should i use it on thr flm ??? it must take up valuable time stopping at waterstations as where the pack gives you continuous movement ... the 2 litrses is heavy at first but soon gors ... ???????
POS morning all ! sounds like everyone is doing brilliantly , so i 'm going to bring the mood down ... nah , not really . although my run at the weekend was not the best it 's still further than i 've ever gone before . is anyone else feeling frustrated even though they are doing things they could n't have comprehended a year ago ? anyway was aiming for 16 miles in 3 hours , but made it back in 3 hrs 25 m , so not great . it was in a new area near worcester and the malverns and was pretty hilly compared to running in sw london , so that 's my excuse ! the only good thing is i have recovered well and have no aches and pains today ! 4 hr 30 is looking like a fading dream but still as long as i make it around i will be happy . silverstone next weekend , when of course the goal is 2 hours , but will be happy to finish feeling good . keep up the good work everyone , not long left now !
POS delia , hopefully will get it all sorted out and it will prove a blessing in disguise for it to have happened now . well done for finishing despite the pain . i 'm sure we 've been told that mental strength is almost more important than physical , and you 've proved yours . what about menu plans for the day before - proven supper dishes to charge us up ?
NEG t & tm hmmm , yes i left my last gym because of the 20 minute rule on the machines . . i had a right go -LRB- in my pathetic doe eyed girly way -RRB- about paying 40 a month so i can train in the warm whilst watching eastenders , and how am i suposed to train for a marathon in 20 minutes a go etc. promptly left and joined their rival ha ! nice to have long rest . i had 3 days off in a row 2 and a half weeks ago , and it really did me good . started feeling very restless though so went and did that ridiculous rhayader race which nearly killed me and had to have another 2 days off ! br ... they say 1gram of vitamin c every 2 hours for 12 hours will rid you of a cold -LRB- yes 1 gram ... may give you a slight orange tinge around the edges though ;o-RRB- -RRB-
NEU mutters ! . anyway , your doggy has gone completely ... where is behind a tree ? glad your back is ok rh . well , having now seen the video ... i am not making copies ... i wobble like mad ... or was it the camera ?
NEG nowt :--LRB- . diet starts after flm -LRB- carbo loading / stress eating just now ! -RRB- . will be reducing my running and reminding myself that i have blubber for fuel so do not need to replace energy following 3 hrs run cos i wo n't be out for more than 60 mins now -LRB- my family wants mummy back ! -RRB-
NEG do n't think i could focus enough on getting all the letters in correct order , think my brain might seize up or somethin' !!
NEG no man with a crippled foot or hand , or who is hunchbacked or dwarfed , or who has any eye defect , or who has festering or running sores or damaged testicles . doubt they 'd have the balls to do that anyway ...
NEG i 'm finding this taper period quite tough to handle mentally , and there 's still 10 days to go ! time is dragging . also i use running to relax and without that outlet i feel a bit wound up ! no matter how many taper articles i read i ca n't escape the feeling that my conditioning is starting to ebb away . stupid i know , but there you go . although i am looking forward to the 17/4 so much it will also be a relief to get my old life back . i shall of course carry on running , but like tallguy i 'm really missing my bike . i have n't run since doing a rather painful 4m on tuesday . my thighs seem to develop new aches each time i get up in the morning plus i have a sore groin . i know there 's nothing serious but it all adds to the tension . i am planning no more than 2 more runs . probably 8m at marathon pace on sat and then a slow 5m next tuesday . followed by a sports massage .
POS just been on the amsterdam website . oooooh , very tempting , and a finish in the olympic stadium ! anyone care to join me for my ` pilgrimage ` run from truleigh hill ? preferably on sunday morning .
NEU gx signs , 130 albion street , southwick . 01273 597799 , dg . usually takes a couple of days . helpful if you have your design on disc , but not essential .
NEG i would have a word with the big fella ' but my line of comunication is down at the mo ' .
POS trinity ... staying with friends/family in letchworth . hope to get down to register on thursday then drive down on sunday morning , -LRB- we found a sneeky parking area within 1/2 mile of blackheath -RRB-
NEG hi all , . good to read that everyone has an eventful weekend . . i did 12m this morning -LRB- 94:11 -RRB- , & it was one of the most uncomfortable runs i 've had in a long time . my left hip pain aggravated me most of the time & i also found that after about 7m my right knee began hurting too . the knee pain was directly above the kneecap & is something completely new to me . i continued to run on with it though & the pain went eventually at about 11m . i 've been icing it -LRB- & the hip -RRB- this afternoon and will continue to do so for as long as is needed . . i will definately be on the start line next week , i just hope it 's not with a strategy that 's had to be revised at the last minute . happy tapering ... ttt .
POS hi i am in this years flm and will be travelling up from dartford train station on the morning of the marathon . i think i will be catching the 7.18 am train to blackheath . starting from the blue start . are there any of you out there that want to meet up . i am hoping to do sub 4 hrs so possible running partner as well or wants to do similar would be good .
NEU ghosts in the pipes ? i am quite happy to talk coherently or otherwise . i am usually the one doing exactly that to those who will listen or even those who wont !!
NEU i 've got a lovely black toenail . i can see it through the hole in my sock :-RRB- -RRB-
POS definitely come to london and spectate - why not join the rw supporters at mile 17 ?
NEU good morning higo , . try punching someone , that helps . . : - > .
POS better to put his information on the urwfrc website , then it will get to the support teams !!!
POS diana , i 'm in pen 9 red start so will try to see you there - meningitis vest , yes ?
NEU delia . i am scottish therefore naturally blue looking so i 'll take my chances on streaking lol . no it should n't wash off . but if it goes on streaky . . i have a wedding next week i need to practise application 4 .
POS hail hail . thanks venom . will try for gfa place , but wont bust my balls for it . paul cameron - is that you pseudo ? if so , well done mate . i owe you a beer . top running .
NEG obviously that should have read , who actually wants to take part . . actually osd , do n't even bother to defer .
NEU oh dont worry i will be ! straight after ! my problem has been trying to stop during training , i have just never managed it for longer than about 2 days ! will probably have a couple of glasses tonight to help me sleep - hopefully wont do me too much harm , after all i 'm certainly not elite .
POS thank god . can someone post another 80 weather threads between now and sunday . cheers .
POS priceless
NEG a picture has to be a . jpg or . gif of 100 x 120 pixels and the size has to be no larger than 12kb . as for getting your picture to that size that 's another matter . mine was trial and error and even when it said it was accepted it took a couple of days to go live .
POS just spotted your posting higo x , well done mate , speak to you tomorrow . i 'm knackered , going to bed . EMO_HAPPY
NEU it was my first marathon yesterday and think i entered a fair time on my form -LRB- 5.10 -RRB- and started in pen 9 . i had been warned about congestion in the first 6 miles but there was none - all very civilised and chance to get a good rhythm going . the dodging and weaving came in the last 6 miles when i was getting a rhythm again after a bad patch through 17-20 -LRB- there were bits where you could n't even try to run in the isle of dogs , it was just a stream of walkers -RRB- . perhaps they can put in theoretical slow and fast lanes -LRB- like at swimming pools -RRB- and walkers are obliged to move into the other lane , with some encouragement from the many course marshalls . however , i do know that at 22 miles when you 're tired etc , the last thing you need is some `` police '' telling you what to do . i plodded in at 5.55 , but with a smile on my face .
POS sounds like my kinda town . thanks dustin . can you lend me the money ? - i 'm sure you made enough from kramer v kramer .
POS and i think dg wants to join us !!
NEU sweetest thing - just goes to show how effective a run/walk can be - only 8 mins slower than me - and i ran all the way . i di n't deduct my loo stop either - although was tempted - do n't see much point though - might look better to everyone else but you still know your time ...
NEU am 46 too but think the tiredness is definitely a hormone thing - nothing to do with my years ! mentally i 'd say i was about 13 ... . have a 5m run planned with a friend on saturday morning - nice and early at 9 . should be ok by then hopefully .
POS katypie - brilliant run , you 're an inspiration to us all and you must stay on this thread . debbo - good run , you must be pleased with that . did you speak to goslo ? have n't seen her on the forum for ages , last spoke to her in fw . hippo - blackpool this weekend , what are you hoping to do , pb ? or are you saving that for cardiff . my knee seems a bit better today , even after 10m yesterday and 4.2 m hilly this morning . i know i have a niggle there and i think a pair of shoes i trained in on friday really aggravated it so they 're going in the bin . i never really liked them anyway and i still have 20 pairs -LRB- and one pair on order ! -RRB-
NEG jane -- i honestly didnt realise at the time . i was supposed to be taking it easy in july
NEG i 'm on 40 + at the moment , although my lr at the weekend was cut to a paltry 8 miles after my husband spent all day out windsurfing . was not amused . probably not a bad thing , though as i had two very tough sessions last week -LRB- one interval and one tempo -RRB- which left me feeling quite sore . my speed is definitely improving , though , so the work is worth it . next sunday should see me up to 18 miles for the long run , and then i go up to 20 milers for the four weeks after that .
NEU hi r-b , running efficiency will improve with fitness , it is normal for beginners to be heavy on their feet as , as you mention , there is n't sufficient pace in the early stages for a smooth heal/toe action . as fitness comes stride will lengthen a bit and breathing will be more in rythm with cadence so the whole action gets smoother .
POS good time trin , well done . shame about all the little prob 's though . hope you heal in time for the robin hood . very good idea dips a meeting before chr ***** s , got any suggestions where . i love that feeling to mava , new running shoes , mine are falling to bits and have a large red stain from a painting accident . i think im gon na have a look for some bargain new ones . im a bit of a skin flint though if there over 35 i cant bring myself to buy them . spent 120 once and they were the worst shoes i ever had , so its back to the bargains .
POS kp - i like 10 mile races . have you ever done the arbroath women 's 10 mile one ? it 's great - lovely route and fantastic home baking and lunch at the end too ! i 'll report back on the suit . actually i do n't know if my post-holiday flab will fit in to it ...
NEU hi everyone , i just wanted to let melf know that i 'm all over the place with my exercise too at the moment . i do feel guilty reading how many of you have set new goals and are working towards those , and i want to recapture the determination i had to stick to a training plan before the marathon . i think maybe now that the autumn weather is coming i might find it easier to get out there , but i know ultimately that the incentive has got to come from me , and not the weather !!
NEU hi all . you 're dead right about the speed sessions kezzabee , i 'm not keen on them at the best of times and quite often the only time i do them is with the running club , or when i run with a couple of mates -LRB- who are usually better than me -RRB- . been doing quite a bit of off road at the moment preparing for my first proper fell race on sunday . although i do n't do any structured speed sessions , you can certainly go pretty damm fast downhill after struggling on your hands and knees up the blxxdy hill in the first place ! went out for a 45 min session at lunchtime , a bit of a slog uphill on the road for a good 700-800 ft of climbing then down through the fields and tracks through the woods which was a bit of fun in my road shoes after the recent rain ! all good practice for sunday , 7 miles and 1000ft of climbing ... ummmm . the guy i was running with is a proper fell runner and did it last year and he was reassuring me ' just dig in on the way up , some of it is hands on knees , and try and hang on , then see if you make up a bit on the way down , just do n't go too fast or you 'll be too knackered for the next steep hill ... gulp . looking forward to it more and more ! , although possibly not as intimidating as that bleep test moggie ! have a good day all . cheers . beders
NEU so , how are people finding out early if they 've got in to flm ? i do n't get it . i thought we did n't find out til december ... lochaber sounds good as an alternative -LRB- had a look at paris last night , but it seems a bit of an expense really what with flying out there etc -RRB- what 's the best way to get there from down here though ? fly to inverness and travel from there ?
NEG and i must remember to switch off the f **** n ' e-mail notification .
POS waiting like you weds , i just spied a thread that i went on two years ago , will boing up for you .
POS do you fancy cardiff ?? < wanders off to check bank account and remember what size fleece i ordered > .
NEG ... crumbs - i go away for 2 days and realise that i 've opened a can of worms !
NEU i would recommend the white peak , although it is a small race with only 200 runners . you are bussed to the start and run back to cromford along the tiisington and high peak trials -LRB- old railway lines -RRB- . although not hilly , it is n't flat either . first 10 miles are gradually up high , second half downhill , with 3 fairly steep downhills . if you want to do it , you will need to move quickly when the entries open due to the limited numbers that can be accepted . there is also a half marathon which runs over the second half of the marathon course .
NEU did you bequeath ? no . date cashed -LRB- or `` not cashed yet '' -RRB- 2nd nov. no of times entered -LRB- not including this ballot -RRB- 0 . number of times rejected -LRB- not including this ballot -RRB- 0 . predicted time code e -LRB- optimistic -RRB- . do you live in london/scotland/other ? other . do you read the sun/other ? sometimes and other
NEG br : . cheeky bugger .
POS more welcomes , . brook and georgias dad , . gd , i am also wating on a club place find out 27 dec. brook youll be fine im sure . . k9 good to see you posting over here again ... enjoy the weekend all - anyone racing . . -LRB- im doing the maylarch eynsham 10k -RRB-
NEU evil pixie - yeah , no worries , go ahead and link to me . . no slacking for me either , now !
NEU micksta - is that 32 as in anything under 33 or 32 as in 32 dead ? because if one of your aims is a sub 16 minute 5k , a 32 minute 10k may be a little ambitious ! mid to low 33s and maybe sub 33 could be a possibilty if it all comes together though !
NEU i put 4:30 lolal though im following a sub 3 hour training plan . lol . in training every day and currently the furthest i have run is 11 miles . lol . im also doing a bit of witght training as im like a stick lol .
POS i have just started this -LRB- week 2 -RRB- and am finding it great as it is based on time rather than mileage - i just wondered if anyone used to last year and how they rated it ?
NEU ow - that sounds painful , stephen ! hurry back slowly - lots of time until flm .
POS trouty - yes and his hm time as well . he should be down in the 73s -LRB- i think his best is 75 . xx -RRB- . then he 'd have a championship place for flm and might be encouraged to have a go . always nice to hear from you at tower bridge - a friendly local face :--RRB- . back any better ?
NEU get into an argument on the forum . spend runs thinking about how to win it EMO_HAPPY
POS christchurch jon - i think that long and slow is the basis for your long runs . i dunno ... a minute , or minute and a half slower than marathon pace ? also , i would imagine that the advice from others would also be along the lines of slowly increasing the distance of your long runs ... 12 miles one week , 15 the next , 18 the next etc ? well , that 's what i 'd do anyway .
NEU toffee , . park nearer woodford station , the roads approaching ashton 's are clear.it 's easier to walk down.parking around the track is a nightmare on race day . yes , people do meet by the water jump , you should n't go wrong .
NEU ahha ... just one thing rich ! you got the wrong shirl ... the one on the other thread is the mark 2 model ! think you will find our shirl has deferred due having a life . . EMO_HAPPY
NEU hi all . thought i 'd just let you know how i got on . well for those of you that do n't know they cocked up the course so we ended up doing just under 14 miles i 'm told ! my time was 2.46 , which if i adjust for the extra reckon it would have been about 2.34 - not bad as i was aiming for around 2.30 ! also had a nasty fall just before ten miles and turned my ankle . kept going but the last couple of miles were hard and had to walk at bit ! but managed to keep running the last mile and even managed a pretty good sprint finish -LRB- good me for ! -RRB- . thoroughly enjoyed it , doing 2 laps did n't phase me and was estatic to finish feeling reasonably good . . legs feel fine - ankle is sort and have two lovely blisters -LRB- one on each foot -RRB- but other than being tired doing good .
NEU i suspect i wo n't be there long enough to offer proper support but you all hang out at mile 17 do you ? teen a is doing the mini mara so i 'll see if it 's plausible to walk back and say hello at least .
NEU jakesy and njord . totally agree with jools b on this and your situation puts everything into perspective does n't it ?! it 's quite easy to get precious sometimes and feel a bit hard done by if you have to run when you 've had a bad day or whatever ... steady undulating 8 miler for me today squeezed in between getting home from work and my little girl 's bathtime . completed in 56:54 which is around 7m 06secs pace and at 65 % whr average . bye for now as off for my tea ! nl
NEG i hope it does n't snow either i 'm working tonight , and running tomorrow
POS is everyone feeling positive and what sort of times are people aiming for ? . i think realistically i am looking at a 5hr 30 .
NEU we only had ten men , ten men , we only had ten men , ten men . sorry toffee but class is always permanent . i thought we played better without gerrard he did n't do anything in the first 18mins anyway . could have had 5 or 6 in all honesty . how ya feeling legless ; 0 -RRB-
NEU -LRB- -LRB- miss delia -RRB- -RRB-
POS bex , very nice run , hope your back is holding up as well
POS fenn , . sainsbury 's ibuprofen tablets . swerve , . i do take your point and will be discussibg further with my physio tomorrow . i 'll report back then . thanks guys ...
POS thanks . last question ! - do you have a favourite ultra ?
NEG gweedore im waiting for a new bum bag , as got to carry gels , phone , mp3 & anything else i might need like plasters , etc -LRB- trying to find a belt with kitchen sink attachment , not found it yet thou -RRB- . i hear the reason paula has pulled out is because of a fast bunch a forum thread on runners world web site , started by a caramel .
NEG i hate it when that happens . i get so scared
POS thanks folks . can get a train about 6.30 from h.h. so would be at london bridge 7.15 - 7.30 so should be ok .
NEU sbf - thanks . the problem seems to be rooted in the back but it 's messing up my gait which has stressed the calves . my physio was ill last week but i 'm seeing him again on thursday . hopefully today 's massage will also help . hope all is well with you .
POS rb - that 's awesome mate ; well earned , and hope you take time to have a few beers and enjoy your holiday . not too bothered about your hr stats -LRB- we 'll let cm sneak off to a private place to drool over those -RRB- , but very keen to hear your mental state throughout the race . eg , . what pace did you set out to run ? did your plan go out the window when you were running well ? at what point did you start thinking about your likely finishing time ? were you consciously -LRB- or subconsciously -RRB- racing crab ? did you think about the feedback you 'd have to supply to this forum ? -LRB- did it help or hinder progress -RRB- - ca n't deny i 've thought about having to cough up my result on here mid-race over the past few months . what was the priority during the last 10k ? just get to the finish , or still aim for a particular time ? was running 2.46 harder or easier than running 3.00 - for me , the quicker the race , the easier it has been , if you know what i mean . did you mentally rehearse your reaction to crossing the line , somewhere around the half way mark ? did you cry ? fkg hope not . what 's next on the rb agenda ? only a couple of minutes from qualifying for those luxury bogs at london next year . questions , questions ... look forward to your answers . crab - keen to know your mental process throughout as well .
NEU mel have you used ice or cold baths after your runs ?? not sure about the drink meeting due to work stuff but planning to go to the expo first thing thursday am , advance notice in case any of you wanted to avoid another pep talk from me and see me shaking like a jelly . when are others planing to pick up their stuff and then shop for england .
NEU should we take are chat over to the free money thread ?
NEU was that your legs or arms fancy ???
NEG sounds like everyone has gone away
POS hmmm . now there 's an idea . . last day at work today so may take myself off for a swim tomorrow afternoon ...
POS just back from picking up my number from the expo . sorry sammy could n't wait til saturday , so i 'll be putting my feet up while you 're standing in the queue . really enjoyed it . got my feet analysed & confirmed that i am a neutral runner which is just as well as i was n't going to change me trainers at this late stage . paul tergat was there but i see he 's dropped out . what with him and paula , if another 30,000 drop out i might be in with a chance .
NEU tempting andy - i wonder if i can persuade the other half -LRB- have two daughters as well who want to be there -RRB- . what hotel is it ? the main reason we 're not staying over is that we 're used to driving to london and it 's only a 90 minute drive -LRB- to stratford or one of the dlr stations -RRB- and about another 30 minutes by tube . . it 's just that all my marathon nerves are being channelled into this one thing right now .
NEU tonight gon na have pasta and sause with vegs mixed in oh with extra garlic just to keep colds at bay . are you eating more or the same amount of food as usuall . . i too feel bloated . . think i should of stopped at 1 bagel .
NEU do you have to run it or can you do it in your car ?
POS thanks jej - did n't know that about the water .
NEG stickless - i have no character : o
POS good luck to all of you for sunday.enjoy your stay in the greatest city in the world.soak up the atmosphere.it 's one big carnival all the way.this is the greatest marathon in the world with the greatest support in the world .
POS have a brilliant day . good luck
NEG in my view the congestion from the blue start seemed to be caused by the ambulance situated after about 800m . i had assumed this was due to some sort of incident that had occured , but watching the video today it was there when the elite woman passed .
POS st paul 's youth hostel - cheap -LRB- 54 for a double -RRB- , quiet , and close to london bridge station . we 've stayed there for the last 3 marathons , and it 's great .
NEU i 'd start raising money for a charity now.the best chance you will have of getting a place is through the golden bond.if you can raise in the region of 1000 by november you 'll have a good chance of getting one.the hardest part of the flm is getting a place . as for the training everything you have said seems right .
NEG i could n't eat after the marathon fenn . my appetite has only just returned . i did force some recovery drink and an energy bar down but that was it . i know that 's wrong rio !
POS sub 6 in my case roobarb !! ;o-RRB- . do you think carole would be ok to give us an hour of her time to share between us ?!?! EMO_HAPPY
POS evening all . was planning on a run or two this weekend , or a bit of cycling , but instead opted for a night out clubbing on friday -LRB- we were in the pub by 4.30 pm and home about 2ish ! -RRB- and then spent the rest of the time paying back my other half for her support since january and spending time with the little one doing some nice ` family things ' . do feel totally refreshed however and literally chomping at the bit now , so going to head out tomorrow after work for a 4 miler . sbf - that analysis of results was fantastic , and ashamed to say that somehow the reds did beat the blues :o-LRB- . i uess we all need to keep the momentum going to achieve the goal of sub 4 . last night just before bed i was watching a little bit more of the live flm coverage i sky + ` ed last sunday . is that your first appearance on tv cas ?? EMO_HAPPY that bob the builder costume must have taken a lot of efort to make , it really was quite impressive . afraid i 'm not going to make abingdon , just not practical for me to get there and already have plans for october i 'm afraid . but i will still hang around here for support/banter with my own races if thats ok ? and maybe next year the flm might be in the picture and we will defo have to meet up ? my race plan for the summer looks like this : . 10 mile race may . 10k race june . 10k race july . half marathon august . not sure about sept yet . half marathon october . with the training required i hope to retain/improve overall fitness and improve speed . and lose a bit more weight !
NEU a solid performance , good pacing throughout . must be harder to run sub 3 in a 17c vienna compared to a 12c london . does n't research on marathon times , find 12c the ideal temp , and 1c above or below that = loss of performance of 1 % -LRB- not sure how they would measure this -RRB- . what 's needed : a cool autumn marathon .
NEG dn . for interest , i never did get an email back from the cardiff race director on the potential safety issues surrounding the 2:30 to 3:00 finishing time . just think of the aggro that the poor winner will suffer ? can i hang on to your skirt tails in abingdon ?
NEU hi guys . not been on here for ages , i am struggling to get properly nack into running again . lovced the marathon and def want to do another one , have entered nottingham half in september so i need to get my backside in gear ! got ill at begiining of may so was out fr a fortnight but i am enjoying do some excercise other than running , back into my circuit training again . by the way i raided 2500 for charity ! well done on the amount you did bp !!! i entered the edinburgh marathon but i have postponed place to next year as was n't able to get the training runs in a the weekends due to being away all the time . glad to see some of you still about .
POS hi all , . been going out a lot with my club recently and really enjoying it . i am definately improving now because of it , last friday we did 2.5 mile relays which was hard but good . i got out with them on mondays and wednesdays . tomorrow we do the haytor heller course which actually takes place on sunday , i am going to be a marshall . did a good 7 mile run last night , a lot of hills . doing a 6 mile race on friday evening which i am looking forward to , i am really enjoying my running at the moment . i am hoping to build up to dartmoor vale marathon in october and then hopefully london again next year .
POS in reverse . if i maintained stride length , and ran 170 spams , my marathon time would be 3:40 .
NEU mike - my target marathon pace his year was 7:00 , -LRB- in 2005 it was 7:15 and the wednesday runs were correspondingly slower -RRB- so that 's what i was working up to . sometimes you get carried away and go a little faster . at the start of the build-up they were a little slower , but as your fitness improves they get to 7:00 so in my eyes they were marathon-paced . threshold running would be 6:40 pace for me . and anywya , if i could manage a 20-mile race at 6:45 pace , surely 7:00 pace is ok for those runs ?
POS hello runners , . well missed a load of posts since the 2006 flm due to ligamant damage ... but am back !! deffered my 2006 place so will be in the 2007 . firstly is this the right place ? sub 4.00 hrs ? or am i too early ?? help !
NEU roobarb also i think everyone recovers differently , after lochaber i raced a 3k and got a pb only 4 days afterwards and after dumfries i raced and got a pb for a 10k only a week afterwards . legs too tired after moray to even think about doing my normal steady pace at the moment never mind race .
NEU is it a full length one ?
POS well its certainly picked up on this thread . welcombe everyone . jellybabe and viffer are well ahead of us on the training front but there 's still plenty of time to go . o'donut which training plan are you going with . stylish like you i have found a couple of races that i have just entered to try the mileage build up . both are hilly off road runs -LRB- bit new to me -RRB- but sound fun ?? drogo 10 and bicton blister both in november in devon . cheques should be cashed at the end of this month if you are in . speak soon EMO_HAPPY

POS susie sorry - fingers still a bit numb several hours later . . lord d thanks for that , but i have been doing the step-drops 30 times every morning before i do anything else and in the evening when i remember . think i 'll work up to 50 reps though . i 've been told i have tendonosis -LRB- i.e. degeneration -RRB- rather than tendonitis -LRB- inflammation -RRB- . probably my achilles had mis-spent youths ! . do n't worry about remedial it for your daughter - it probably means she has excellent social and other non-cognitive skills instead ! lots of evidence -LRB- from day-job -RRB- that non-cognitive skills -LRB- e.g. communication , team-working , self-efficacy -RRB- are increasingly important in the labour market .
NEG accobatic overhead kick to hammer it home
NEG oops - sorry roobs , forgot about luton !
NEU we seem to be very well-catered for with half marathons in the north west as build up : - helsby , village bakery , great north western , wilmslow , liverpool . but there is a distinct shortage of further distances . the milford 21 -LRB- miles -RRB- in staffordshire is the only longer run i can find in travelling distance - anyone know one of any other 20-milers anywhere near the north west ?
NEG guess who is hung over this morning and has n't run ... ... ... ... . bloody gremlins !
NEU susan . activate your e-mail link and i will e-mail you . i have n't received a reply to the charity who contacted me :o-LRB- -LRB- -LRB- . . . and i have support of my employer to guarantee bond :o-RRB-
POS i 'm in for macmillan . there must be more of us because their website says all their gb places are taken !
POS remember to miss a session if you need to as well . it is early days yet and there is a long way to go to stay fit and healthy
POS good luck susie have a good run . sounds like the training is going well .
POS sounds like a good plan nickm , i will do the same . the massage was good thanks , my calfs tighten quite easily so i really need a good session once every two or three weeks . . i also started using fetch in 2007 . good fun and even takes the football and badminton in as x training . no garmin or anything more than a watch here so it is my only source of information . . i have n't sorted my flm place yet jbss but am still hopeful . it may have to be charity in the end though . i will let you know what success i have . our club places went to a husband and wife this year ... very cosy ! hmmmph ! later .
NEG i did n't buy any official merchandise last time i ran london marathon 2002 . i sort of regretted it afterwards but looking through the adidas gear it seems a bit pricy has anyone here bought anything from the london marathon range is it good and is it worth paying the extra to have a london marathon logo on it ?
POS blimey alex - where did all that come from ?! two glasses of shiraz maybe . how decadent , drinking at lunch time at work ! reminds me of the old days < harpy music wafting into the past > ... would love to do ny . must see if i still have any knee cartiledge left after flm this year . clare - is your half on sunday a race race or a race to make a long run more interesting ?
NEU shakes head . speedwork . not good for one ;-RRB-
NEG ahhhh ... beginning to think i should have gone out for a run last night this does n't sound too good ...
NEU just a few laps of retiro parque in madrid for el toffee this evening ! think ive just scraped in 10-12 miles this week so far , but the comeback is on !
NEU evening all , . jonny w. was a wizard - i was only 8 mins out ! . therefore if i predict 30-31 mins for my 10k race tomorrow i should be ok . i suppose the folks who went to twickers are still swigging back the sauce somewhere in sarf london . a few approx . stats again then pug . cm . keep on swimming and pj ` ing - look what it did for jonny w. if i have a shit race tomorrow , its been nice knowing you all if only briefly - i 'll be relocating .
NEU rio 's just ` precious ' about other stuff laugh out loud !!!
NEU
NEU daz if i have to pull my finger out can i use yours , as you so kindly offered earlier ?!! go easy on that drive home . middle pinks is driving home from b ` ham this afternoon so hope it does n't snow again . whats it like in london ? nicks how is that leg ? are you doing lsr tomorrow ? i 've got 15 on my schedule and it looks chilly out there !
NEU hippo . the more job , the more chance of you getting one . . i am being careful of my knee , having a massage next wednesday . hope your legs get you round draycote .
NEU cg - its a shame to hear you say `` this thread is a little bit scary '' . if you are aspiring to sub 3:15 then surely this is your thread ? there are a good few on here that are now running sub-3 style mileage and times , probably as a result of training going better than expected , and i hope no-one else has been put off by this or is worrying too much that their mileage/speed is n't up to it ? i know i 've ran 3:06 before off about 40mpw and 7.8 min/mile lsrs , so i figure so can anyone else . anyway after all that rambling i do n't have anything more to say wrt your question that has n't been said above . e.g. , i let my legs chose my sunday lsr pace and it ended up being a lot faster than most training plans would suggest - am yet to find out whether or not that was a stupid thing to do . . was it really worth the risk ? doubt it .
NEG finally gotten rid off my cold after 10 days , bloody thing . depending on whats on telly later and how awake i feel -LRB- went from evening shifts to morning shifts with work today so i get less sleep for a night -RRB- will see how far i run tonight . currently tipping down so i think it 'll be a treadmill session . aim for 6 miles roughly i think . got ta remember to ask what each trendline on my funky spreadsheet graph is as i hav n't a clue , mainly as its a spreadsheet i aquired off another runner at work . heck even the boss has been out a few times over the last few weeks at lunchtime .
POS ... and good luck on sunday m4
NEU 9 miles for me today at 8:30 pace . just one more session tomorrow then a mini-taper for hastings on sunday . looking forward to a couple of rest days after 10 consecutive days of running . hastings should be a good test , but the bbc weather site is forecasting 29 mph sw winds on sunday which will make the last 2.5 miles along the seafront a bit of a drag !
POS hi dazpd good to have you back today !!
NEU erm , i got mine last saturday .
NEU -LRB- whoops , a pb by 3 mins not 4 -RRB-
NEU gosh , it 's good to know there are others a bit like me ! starting out a bit fast is a worry just because i have not done the distance before .
POS sc/ld . many thansk for your advice . simon
NEU pg - here is the link to the part of this site with the rcae time calculator on it . basically it is a formula used to convert one races time to anothers which is pretty accurate and is also in the middle of the range you would get if you used some of the other ways of working out race times from other races . debra - well done on the 15 miles . i managed to get 6 miles done in 56 mins running aorund stafford on tuesday night as i was down there for a conference with work . stopping up in the bar until 1am and a slight twinge in my ankle meant i ditched the planned 6 or 9 mile run pre breakfast . did 6 mile on the treadmill before work at lunchtime and the ankle was n't to bad just a minor ache at the moment so i think i 've tweaked it probably on the rough ground alongside the dual carriage way in stafford . still looking to do 20 miles or so on sunday and as of yet i hav n't decided where i 'll run too , probably stock up on drinks and some food and just run where ever the heck i feel like it . i 'll probably check i can measure off my garmins sporttracks stuff indivdual sections so i can combine in a load of differing sized laps in the area .
POS rw supporters thread :
POS greetings all , . still one hard week for me to go , . had a great day today , a nice 5.5 m slow at lunch and then ... a club run meant to be done at mp tonight , well that didnt happen , 1st mile at 8m then the next 4 very quick , in fact very quick for me ... . is everything starting to kick in , as felt tired but comfortably strong at the same time ... . . great tips above , . also dont forget the sun cream lotiion , the abount of times i have been wind and sun burnt at maras ... . also plenty of vasaline in any area that can rub , crutch , grion area , butt cheeks , arm pits etc. and for the men the nipples either plasters / tape or vasaline ... take care
POS hi willy , whats your marathon pb ? if i was you i would go for 2 ; 45 , what have you got to loose ? your not that far off and your times are very close to mine .
NEG the simple question to ask is : . `` do you want my money or not ? '' . that is if you have raised any ... i 'm very surprised they are not jumping through hoops to sort this for you .
NEU what does your physio say about cortisone injections ?
NEU i had cortisone injection for nerve problem in foot.seemed to take a few days for it to work but definately worked for me . doc would n't do it for me had to go private . good luck
NEG website is now complete . runners world london marathon 2007 runners & supporters website . <u> no updates have been made to add any runners since thursday last week , i shall update these tomorrow . some other minor updates are also outstanding </u> . if you encounter any problems with the website or have any suggestions please email me .
POS x-post there with sandra ! as i said , i 'm happy to go along with the rest of you .
POS thanks for suggesting a meeting spot alex - i was hoping you would . . EMO_HAPPY . i 'll be wandering over from the isle of dogs -LRB- after dropping off the rather fabulous `` rw forum supporters 100m ahead '' sign i made , at mile 17 - watch out for it !! -RRB- and should be there about 08:30 i guess . white cap , shelter vest with keryn on the front . got last minunte tickets to the arsenal game last night - woohoo !! although the minging bread roll soaked in mayo and the late night were n't the best for taper week . ah well , it was a good game and we are now up to third in the table ! EMO_HAPPY
POS eleanor - i thought about a tutu as well - good plan to get encouragement . we have the same rw support group 6 at mudchute .
NEU i have no hair . EMO_HAPPY
POS sub i 'm meeting hilly at the elite ladies start about 8:45 am tomorrow , then yomping down maze hill towards 6 -7 mile point . i will e-mail my phone no . to you .
POS morning all . just spent the last 10 mins catching up with everyones posts/reports . congrats and well done to everyone ! in reality it was that hot that it was an achievement just to finish ! well that has to be the toughest thing i have ever done . i expected the last 6 miles to be tough but that was something else ! finished in 3.18.58 . am absolutely chuffed to bit and still have n't stoped smiling ! think i slept about 2 hours last night , i 'm still buzzing ! annoyingly i think i made the last few miles so hard myself by going off too fast ! at 14 miles i was had averaged 7.17 min miles , including 5 around 7 mins . by 18 i had dropped the pace slighty to about 7.30 mins miles and was still well on for sub 3.15 -LRB- about 3.13 ish -RRB- if i could have kept that pace up . but from 20 onwards it seemed like someone had tied bricks round my ankles and i dropped to 7.50 's and by 24 8.10 's . managed to run a sub 8 in the last mile but the heat and my quick start had finished me . think if it had n't been for the crowd i would have pulled over and collapsed in the gutter , but had a lot of friends placed over the last few miles that really kept me going ! anyway am really pleased and honestly think i have got sub 3.15 in me . just have to learn from my mistakes and hope its cooler next time !
POS yes thanks rio for all your help along the way it has been much appreciated ! . yeah i 'm the same as you sarah , i think it might be the start of a beautiful friendship with running haha !
POS i 'm a size 8 , so could go camping in it . it 's now displayed in the loo for all to admire - especially me ...
NEU morning ... i have no intention of running until the bank holiday weekend . but i am on the verge of entering the needles xc half on 3 june ... any takers ?
NEG alex should i have a e-mail from you did not recieve anything micktherunner . com
NEU who 's that lurking there in the shadows . oh hello mick , how 's phil these days . got any races planned ? have you had a look at the petition ?? hippo - do n't you think it 's about time you gave that body of yours a rest . when 's your next race planned . i know you have to have a run every day , but you need some time to recover . you 'll end up burning yourself out . ca n't keep up that pace forever you know . now behave yourself and have another drink . hic not too heavy on the tonic though , you know what it does to you .
NEU thanks bowi just a bit too far away for me to come and train with you sometimes . not an excuse a reason . .
NEU -LRB- -LRB- roobs -RRB- -RRB- hope the pain eases soon and/or you get a cancellation . luckily a lot of the cutty sark artifacts , masts etc. had been removed for refurbishment , so were n't there - does n't look to be all that much left , that 's for sure . -LRB- -LRB- kp 's nose -RRB- -RRB- .
NEU afternoon . roobs , i decided yesterday not to do today race as my left leg ached . shades . well done on your marathon . -LRB- -LRB- -LRB- roobs -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- . sorry to hear that you are poorly .
POS corredor - great pb , but just a word of warning - advice from one of my club coaches : better to improve on your pb by 5 seconds each race than take a huge chunk off and then have to beat that next time . on a more positive note -LRB- unless you 've been running for years ... -RRB- , i also read that whatever age you start running/racing , you will improve on your times for c. 10 years before you plateau , so go for it .
NEU i really dont know if they will be worth looking at ! lol . but the new trisuit i have looks ok so i wont be shy for the cameras ! laugh out loud
NEU morning all , very hungover , or in fact maybe still drunk . had good night out in wimbledon where met up with a group from work who were out for a leaving do - girl who works in our gym moving to pastures new . ended up in nightclub . no idea what time we got home ? have got blisters and kitchen is bomb site after late night peanut-butter toast making . . no running for me today . hope things are ok for your guys `` up norff '' ? i am referring to the flooding . mean wendy & tutu as opposed to susan who although is north of the river and virtually foreign climes , i do n't think had weather issues .
NEU padams - i 've just been sent the results from last night . the overall standings -LRB- after 3 races -RRB- make interesting reading . pos overall score points . 1 garden city runners 850 36 . 2 st albans striders 1517 28 . 3 barnet & district 1593 26 . 4 royston runners 2187 15 . 5 nhrr 2119 14 . 6 bishops stortford 3060 7 . you will need to put a good team out for your home event next week if you do n't want barnet to take second place from you -LRB- they came within 60 points of beating us last night -RRB- . it 's also going to be close to see who out of royston and nhrr will be relegated . the person who won is down in the results as having a double-barrelled surname . good luck to those of you having a punt this afternoon .
NEU tunbridge wells and tonbridge are 4 miles apart . i grew up tw but now live in tonbridge . the tour de france is going through both . didds lives in neither . he works in tw but lives in bex hill which along the coast from hastings . didds are you going to watch out goudhurst way ?
POS well done katie , vrap and girlfriend on your awesome efforts . vrap - i think you are being too modest . a pb after that sort of exertion is phenomenal . fast times too for lorenzo and tt . mtr - you will soon be back on form and will fly in your ds trainers . are you planning to alternate them with a different shoe ? . rfj and smiffie - thoughts are with and do n't rush back . it 's not fun . i seem to be in an increasing amount of pain and am ccoming to the conclusion that i might have to stop running again . i was given the number of a good physio but luck would have it that she is off on holiday for 3 weeks . i had quite a long telephone conversation wit her and she thinks i now have a secondary injury -LRB- possibly pf -RRB- caused by adjusting to compensate for original injury . i will carry on running as long as the pain gets no worse but i 'm not looking forward to my hm tomorrow.finishing that will be harder than any race i have ever done . no pbs for me in the near future !
NEU hey pug . sorry to hear about the injury . best advice from me is put all your renowned focus oin to getting it right - do whatever the fizz / sports therapist says - treat the ice / stretch / mobility exercises or whatever as if they are key parts of your training program . then , see how it goes , maybe you could refocus on luton -LRB- 1st weekend in december -RRB- as tipptop suggests , or come down to la rochelle the weekend before with me . even if you do n't get a champs start for london , you will still have a pen 1 green start , and i 'm sure you would n't let a couple of eastenders actresses get in your way ! blisters . judging by the state of worcester city centre today , you 're not wrong about what 'll be with you sunday and monday . - never seen the river so high , and its going to take a while to receed because no matter where you go there are great expanses of water linked to the smallest of streams as the underlying water table has risen so much . managed to find a 7 mile dryish route this evening - would have been a slightly more achilles friendly 6 , but i got stuck on the tow path for a while with canal on one side and flooded road on the other - thankfully it had stopped raining by that point , otherwise i might have been a tad worried !
POS caro - the smell of the fish n chips is the same as the smell of a bacon buttie - irresistable ! you 'll be up for it !
NEU welcome back tr . good running dana . good racing jej . will have to give video clip a miss due to dial-up connection at home and very effective security at work . which leaves me with today 's 10k attempt . the fred consensus earlier in the week was that my endurance is good , my speed is not . oh boy , that was the case today . i could list some excuses -LRB- missed a week after dorney , only one speed session since , and that was on tuesday , high mileage for me since , etc. -RRB- but the truth is is was just a bad day at the office . a very bad day at the office . legs felt a bit heavy in my warm-up but the first k was done in 3.48 and i thought things would be alright . but from then on in my legs got heavier and heavier . it 's a fast-ish course , but not pancake flat . i finished in a miserable 40.53 . not a pw -LRB- principally because my first ever race was a 10k and i 've tended to do 10ks at the start of training blocks , untapered -RRB- but not what i wanted . will probably write it off as 6 miles @ hmp as frankly that 's all it was . ho hum . will console myself with a recovery run this evening so that at least the mileage total for the week does n't get wreaked to boot .
NEU probably 1 1/2 inches wide pinks
NEU well done tracey & roobs on your long runs . lyndy - i get up most mornings at 4.30 to 4.45 to go training , but for my long runs i do go out a bit later as i like to have my brekkie first . morning is the best time of day to run . i hate running at night , have to go out tonight for a short run before going to the gym as i 'm a bit behind on this week 's mileage , it 's 28 degrees down here in devon today
POS evening all . loads of posts to catch up with . tr - one of my favourite subjects that - the grandparent rule in football . always made me laugh that at the same time as ireland were getting grief over using it , england had butcher -LRB- born in singapore -RRB- , barnes -LRB- born in jamaica -RRB- and dorigo -LRB- born in australia -RRB- playing for them ... i always maintained that the rule made sense though as emigration was becoming much more common . the rugby one is a joke though , live somewhere for 2 years and you can play for them . we played italy last year , and they substituted a springbok for an argie . i thought we were playing an allstar xv . sorry to hear the knee is playing up btw . fingers crossed it 'll clear up in time for nf . jej - i do n't see any reason why you ca n't be down at that level yourself in time . might take a bit more mileage though . that 's obscene to be able to do that pace off so little mileage . fair play to him . i 've got a rest day tomorrow , tf . made it through yet another mad week of training with just a slightly tight left quad to show for it . i think that 's a decent return ;--RRB- total for the week was 120 -LRB- off 6 days , with some good quality in there -RRB- . counting back 7 days i 've done 128.25 so dull , i 'm afraid your pb is mine ! ;--RRB- -RRB- could n't do it on a regular basis though . only 1 more week of this to go , and i have to say i 'm glad . i think it 's the mental side i find harder than the physical side . still , what does n't kill you ... .
NEU roobs . listen out between 1pm and 2pm .
POS mornin all . had a really good club run last night , a hilly 7 miles . for the last few weeks i 've got back to the club feeling like a complete wreck , as i 've linked in with a group of runners who are a bit faster than me , and several times around the course i 've been puffing and panting so hard and thinking ... . . i ca n't do this ... ... i ca n't do this , but just about hanging on in there . anyway last night , i got back feeling ok ... in fact as high as a kite as i kept up , with only feeling the ` omegod i ca n't do this ' once , and that was up a long hill , but did it . strange how your body -LRB- or my body anyway -RRB- seems to struggle along at the same pace for so long , then suddenly feels better one night for no apparent reason . just hope it stays . probably the tough speed session last week helped ? will rest achilees now 'till club run -LRB- about 5-6 miles -RRB- on friday , then try and get round 13.5-14 mile course on sunday , in last sundays time of around 1.53 ish . not bothered if i do n't , but nice to have something to aim at . good luck to all those of you in races this weekend .
POS crikey - so much positive stuff on this thread . well done all you racers , good to switch on the laptop read through the weekends postings . our house resembled emergency ward 10 this weekend with both small children badly ; one recovering from an op and beginning to milk it somewhat -LRB- he is male -RRB- the other -LRB- female -RRB- quietly ill on the sofa with some kid-like lurgy . managed to run never the less . 6.5 ish easy miles on saturday -LRB- no gadgets at all so no pressure , which i prefer for this type of run -RRB- 12 miles this afternoon , kept up a decent pace in view of the fact i was n't going mega long and averaged 8.25 mm on an undulating route . did what i always do and started slow -LRB- 9mm , 8.40-8 .45 s -RRB- then picked up the pace as the run went on to 8-8 .15 mm . the last 3 miles of this route are pretty much all climb so it 's tough to pick but the pace further but useful training i feel . good running all .
NEU what 's more -LRB- i 'm sorry if i sound a bit full of myself -RRB- but whilst checking the edinburgh marathon website i noticed the age qulification based on half-marathons is 1:35:00 which is only 2 min 30 secs faster than my pb . does anyone know of a flat half near london in the next two months !
POS dan a - only a couple of miles from me . it would be nice to recoup the cost of my new apartment in prize money , but i guess i 'd have to win the flm for that . any good team prizes - i can think of 3 other local 29 - 32min guys ... ?
NEU hrr - feel sure you could gfa at edin . have you found any suitable looking halves yet ? what about leicester ? entries shut on weds this week but they 're saying that , because there are some postal strikes , it 's best to enter online . there 's a course profile - does n't look too bad except at mile 8 but i 'm not sure if it 's a hill or just a slight incline . i 'm not v. good at judging things , altitude-wise . . leicester marathon site .
NEU nickm ... you can keep the congratulations at the back of the cupboard and get them out another time ... i have re read the post and i now see what you mean ... i wondered why you were devestated : -0 ... still a nice run though ...
POS about 5 times laugh out loud
NEU afternoon all , . done my last pre-leicester run yesterday a slow 3.8 miles in 33-18 , if i could run at that pace for another 22miles i would be very pleased -LRB- approx 3-49 marathon -RRB- i wish . . chest still feels a little tight and i have a niggly cough but should be ok but i know i have not done enough long runs , none over 18miles . ozy weather sounds good for sunday , sounds like you are getting better , hope to see you at the start . beders , a hatrick your totp mojo is back hope the running is going well .
NEU ode i 'll mail you tonight mate , cheers as will be ordering these lights asap . omfg , i 'm now 10th in the marathon alltime list . . this is n't good . . literally holding on by my fingernails is n't nice . . about to drop into the abyss . right , where 's a local marathon EMO_HAPPY . pug EMO_HAPPY
NEG if you bequeathed and do n't get a place , when do you know that you 've been unsuccessful ?
POS have a good break , debstir , and come back rested and refreshed to start your training ! beachy is next saturday .
NEG bah , stupid halifax ! nothing at all there , of any description . do n't despair people - there 's always tomorrow ! ed - go to bed !
POS ` those socks ' obviously referring to these beauties . but would other people wear them if they thought they would help to win races ?
NEU caro i understand completely . it will go , honest . but you really do need to take it easy til that cold clears . a couple of years ago i had a runner with one of my groups who had a cold . she ran with me and we did speed reps. she ended up with double pneumonia ! so be warned . rest and lots of warm fluids is best . when they say feed a cold i think they mean just to ensure you have plenty of vitamins and minerals etc -LRB- from the days when people had really bad diets -RRB- so lots of vitamin c and do as much -LRB- or little -RRB- as you feel up to .
POS the dangerous book for boys is a superb read ! i got one for my birthday , loads of handy things in there including how to win at conkers and how to build the ultimate treehouse .
NEU coxy . i can see there buildings from my window . what have i done , ive just entered the benfleet 15 on 27th january multi terrain . and iam a bit of a woosie in muddy conditions . oh well chin dtb you will be on the mend soon iam sure .
POS looking at the route , i like the idea of the later stages on day 1 in epping forest and the north downs way sections on day 2 . not too long , and quite hilly .
NEU richard , are the programs available online somewhere ?
POS hi all , went out for a short run on the track . lots of wind and rain managed to run at a comfortable pace . this gives me confidence to try and achieve 35 min or there abouts in the 5 mile race on sunday . it will be a pb what ever happens as i have never done a 5 mile race before . 4.3 miles .11 m/m = 30m57s ave hr 164-82 % max hr 186 max speed 12.6 mph .
NEU dl . 2 weeks is n't so bad , and its good timing for family brownie points . get the swimming done instead .
POS just get out and run - you know the basics - build in rest days and work on building distance . try a run tomorrow to see where you are in terms of fitness .
POS have fun everyone !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
NEU pug , i raced 3 times and did intervals between crimbo and new years day : -0 . jej , either you complimented me for my efforts or you are calling me slow for taking so long to do the miles : -0
NEU oh yes of course dave - they come in handy for wading through fields of horse poo and mud ! right . off for my 6-8 miles before my group tonight . got a beginner starting so be back to run/walk for a bit . happy training EMO_HAPPY
POS wardi i failed to run sub 1.30 at milton keyneshm 06 and shortly after ran a 3.01 pb at abingdon 06 . i would n't get too down about a performance in just one race . i remember talking to you post flm07 . my advice -LRB- for what it 's worth -RRB- is just keep working . i have run 4 pb 's in 2007 , having started road racing aged 46 . sadly none over the marathon distance , but i 'm convinced by the way i feel that i 'm still getting faster and stronger the more i train . i am lucky enough to sometimes chat to rivals . one of them told me they started aged 38 and reckoned they peaked at 52 . the guy is now 58 and considerably faster than me . keep on trucking . it 's a long road , but hopefully we will both get our over 50 sub 3 . best wishes . dull .
NEU the ocd got the better of the cnba , so i went out for the lunchtime reps session4 x -LRB- 5 min hard + 30 sec off + 1 min hard + 90 sec off -RRB- the last long rep was stopped halfway as the lead guy went over on his ankle - he was ok , so after a couple of minutes we finished with a fast 3 min . a tough session , esp when running into the wind . . like joolska , i do n't mind occasionally running for charity , but i do n't like assumption that the two go hand in hand by default . when mrsc and i got married in '06 we took the view that as we had being living together for the previous 11 yrs , already had 2 kids , mortgage etc we did n't want wedding presents so we asked people to sponsor us . our friends/family were very generous at the time , so i would n't want to ask people again .
POS good running martin ! does n't matter if runs are a little shorter than the schedule , would n't worry too much . back from my intervals , really enjoyed them yet again - yay ! did 7 x 800m fast with 2 min recoveries . still do n't do them spectacularly fast , think the fastest averaged 7.30 mm pace and the slowest was around 10 !! -LRB- v. steep hill though -RRB- . quick question re : hill-running . do you guys run hills on your toes ??? feels like such an amateur question to ask , but have only just noticed what a different it makes , it 's incredible !! however , right big toenail is black again and very weak , so not sure they like it so much .
NEG afternoon all . another outbreak of sensibility this end . had a carp night , kept waking up cos of the lurgy , so decided to forego the planned lsr and slept instead . no running til monday at the earliest this end now . still , at least i got 50 + in the bag . just a shame i missed out on the other planned 40 ... . sorry to see there 's other lurgified folks , but better now than 2-3 months time ! do n't know what 's going on with everybody being sensible . must be something in the water ! at this rate i reckon next week will be primarily slow mileage again , which will leave me with a 9 week build up and a 2 week taper . should be more than enough to get my tergat i think . gatorade - league ? km - i wear adidas supernova cushion too . have you found a replacement for them cos the new models are wider across the midfoot , or does that not affect you ? good luck to all weekend racers .
NEU hey gd , . just popped over from the other thread to say hi ! i too am trying to lose weight and do n't eat meat and a finding it tricky . does anyone have the link for nam & bear 's thread ? i ca n't seem to find it . hope you manage to fix your problem !
POS count your blessings , eh !
POS afternoon folks . nice to see your back trin.rich made me laugh the other week describing the ice baths you get him to take after any run over 15 miles.he says he keeps stopping at 14.99 miles !! EMO_HAPPY . he 's nearly convinced me its a good idea ... well done on surviving the river bank rollick rich . i 've never fancied it as every year the conditions seem to be appalling ! nice to see the monument route on your dream team page.welcome to hogweed country !! hope you all enjoy your long runs this weekend.at least it should be dry here in brizzle .
POS brave man blisters . be a warrior , it is your destiny . good luck
POS blisters top running , great effort . . the forum shows theres been some good training this weekend . i managed my first ever 18 mile run on sunday , tried to make it slow as recommended , but ran it in 2hr 17 mins -LRB- maybe a bit too fast for 1st time on longest ever run -RRB- . at the end felt tired and realising just how far 26 miles really is . . today i went for what was supposed to be a short slow run with a friend who is also running flm . unfortunately friend is very fast experienced runner -LRB- around 3hr for marathon -RRB- and i wanted to try and keep up . we did 9.3 mile cross country in 1hr 8min felt like nearly tempo pace due to wet boggy ground . i am going to take it slower for rest of week , but feel good -LRB- no aches or pains -RRB- .
NEU i have n't touched alcohol since the day i bought my first car 23 years ago , so it 's not an issue for me . kenyan hills tonight - 3 x 10 minutes with 2 minutes recovery between the sessions . averaged around 6:40 pace with the heartbeat average and max slowly climbing until the last few laps had a peak of 167 and an average of 166 ! safe to say i could n't have gone much harder . quite a satisfying session though , if only my shins were n't so sore afterwards . time for a soak in the bath i think .
NEU for me , sore knees means i need a new pair of trainers . how old are yours ? you might also want to look at ` shock absorbing ' inserts for you trainers - sorbothane inserts are what i use . try running offroad also . dave
NEU lardarse - haile only got to half way last year . be careful copying him ! gels and jelly babies seem identical in content , and i 've used both . for the race last year , i carried a couple of gels but did n't actually use them . the lucozade sport seemed to work fine for me . for training runs , i do n't bother with gels or any food . the idea on long slow runs is to train your body to burn fat and slowly deplete the available muscle glycogen , so i feel it counterproductive to fuel during the run . as for one jelly baby per mile - whatever works for you really . be aware that you will burn 100-150 calories each mile , so any food intake for fuel replacement will make a relatively small impact -LRB- unless you can consume 100 calories per mile , in which case you will struggle to force it down ! -RRB- . timing-wise , the earlier you consume the better . nothing you eat after 18 or so miles will make any difference , as it takes a fair amount of time to metabolise the gel / food . same principle for water - drink early before you are really thirsty , rather than playing catch-up with fluids later in the race .
POS hope you manage an extra few hours kip , tracey .
NEU yes , you do . but you 're allowed coz it is your thread EMO_HAPPY . good run rich . these long one are getting hard now are n't they .
NEG thing is , i did n't think you could post unless you were a subscriber .
POS thanks jools , will appreciate the support .
POS do n't worry doodle ! had a massage last night and seeing the physio tomorrow morning and have been icing all yesterday . unfortunately my knees have a tendency to do this marathon training or not . but it 's much better today . thanks EMO_HAPPY how are you fairing ? lucy i totally agree about the speedwork , it 's all about just getting round in one piece this time and working on speed after that !
NEU brian . run slower in the 20 so not to kill yourself . rb . patience . pp . good to see more common sense being used
NEG tootie really sorry to hear about your bath experience . i have to say that most of my own worst running experiences have come in really big races . i much prefer less congestion and fewer fat joggers in headphones , too many clothes , carrying 10 gels and 2 water bottles who stupidly line up in the sub-1 :30 pens getting in my way . less hanging about at the start when the fields are smaller too . . so well done on merely suriving that horrible experience . chin up lass !
NEG padams - must have been a small chap ... you better had over your prize before he gets angry
NEU hi everyone . ive had a couple of gym sessions this week , just taking it easy , well done on the 9mile run during the week caz i wish i could find the time and the energy . i 'm not running for any charity this time , i do the great north run every year and raise for diabetes uk , i know when i 'm on the start line i will feel guilty for not raising anything and you see the tshirts and charity tops but i just didnt want the hassle this time round . good luck with everyones fund raising efforts , i know how hard it can be . what day is everyone going to the expo , im going on saturday morning as im travelling down on the 6.00 am train from durham .
NEU gatton did you get out for your 10 miler today ?
NEU due to my lack of hair - i might tie the two tone ribbons round my neck and then when you are passing you can pull me along with you - a bit like i pull my aged dog with me when i run !! ;--RRB-
NEG oh dear , i just check the weather for paris - 4 and light snow , we will be giving out hot toddies along the way . i hope it is not that cold for us .
NEU what bej said but + about 5 seconds for 14.59 . i ended up 4th and was beaten into 3rd by a guy who cheated as he had n't run the extra distance ;--RRB- . one more decent session to go and i 'm hoping to be close to 100 % for it , if not , i 'm hoping to at least be 100 % for the big day !
NEG padams . not in great shape , but still waiting in the wings . . would be a real bummer if this late someone gets a knock/flu and there was no one trained up ready to step in . still such is the quality of the squad , though i think you 'd crack the record with just 11 . dull .
NEG i had a quick squint at the website and ca n't see any way of tracking participants -LRB- not that we know race numbers of phil , br , hilly , etc. . . -RRB- . right , must stop wasting time on t ` internet or i 'll never get out of the office in daylight !

NEU marigold . nice one - this is who you 're looking for . did 3 or 4 miles after work and some strides . knee still aches but wtf , after 20m i bet everything else will hurt too .
POS timely xpost - thanks crab
NEU i would recommend waiting at least two weeks before signing up to any more marathons . i signed up to two just after flm 2006 - spent the year training for marathons . having said that i have also signed up for flm '09 but mostly to keep my rejection count up . if i get a place next year it will defo . be done as a fun run with some outfit or other - no ladies cloths or underwear though as i saw quite enough of that on sunday during the race .
POS i cant make friday but how about we all meet sometime and run along the embankment to westminster and then along birdcage walk and round to the finish line !!!! if we do it in the summer we could have a picnic and bubbly in the park afterwards ? EMO_HAPPY

POS hi folks , . bit nervous about posting in here amongst proper serious runners but i am looking for a little advice and perspective , if possible ? long story short is that i began running in late summer 2005 and completed the dublin marathon in oct 05 in 4:23 . since then i have finished a further 6 in progressivly faster times until i hit 3:15:06 in rotterdam at the weekend . i 've also done a couple of 10k races as ` sharpeners ' , the most recent of which was ~ 600m short and i finsihed in a race time of 37:5 x , so i figure it would have been ~ 40min mark for the full race distance . training stayed pretty static at 30ish miles until the last marathon where i upped it to around 35 - 45 miles per week on average and brought in speed work for the first time . having finsihed rotterdam feeling fairly strong -LRB- last three miles were all under 7:06 min/mile pace -RRB- i have this mad idea that i couldgo a bit faster . current plan is to focus on a 10k race at the end of june -LRB- i 've never focussed on a 10k before and it 'll be interesting to see how fast i can go -RRB- and then a marathon in oct. but i have this mad idea that - with proper speedwork and more miles - i might get close to teh magic 3 . am i being delusional ?
POS bootsie - abingdon is a nice marathon . it was my first marathon .
NEG i 've never been to a medium . it was as much as i could do to drop below extra large .
NEG ff . do n't they ask for your competition licence number to get the affiliated discount ? all races from 1 april this year are meant to do that ...
POS yes , there are some places that are reserved just for people who bequeath their entry fee .
NEU i got through to the thank you page on the flm site but have not had any confirmation emails and am in limbo
NEU well not too hopeful trig as i 've done flm twice , so doubt i 'll be lucky again lol . even if i was in , unlikely you 'd get to cane me , you 'd have to catch me first laugh out loud ;--RRB-

NEG broke my treadmill last night . started smelling like a bonfire and would not change gradient . thought best to get off . anyone know any contacts that can fix ` tunturi ' treadmills ?
POS hi susan , yes the team runners do run with the full mara - you can only identify them by their freshness and their numbers EMO_HAPPY
POS no i did not laugh out loud i just do not know what happened there ???? i know i will be beaming all the way home tomorrow ! not bothered i have to stop at schiphol airport 3 hours i will just sit with a glass of wine and watch the world go round EMO_HAPPY . i am not sure i can go any lower !!! i said it was my last but we always say that . thanks for all the support everyone ! i am so pleased i came back on the thread . i only left last year as was so low after london and lost lots of confidence now i have found it again !
NEU well that 's it for me - the last , slow , sluggish 4 miles of training complete at lunchtime so it 's time to put me feet up and eat , eat , eat . i can do no more , what will be will be , etc. setting off at lunchtime tomorrow - it 's a different country after all , so must take ages to get to . rb - wo n't be joining you for the meal , but are you still looking to tootle down to the start from haymarket on sunday morning ? i 'll have the family with me so i 'll be going at pushchair pace , but let me know if you want someone to wander down with .
NEG good luck with your training plans susie and tootie . ca n't advise dids on a new garmin . i have been leading an economist 's awayday in birmingham for 2 days , which was very successful i think . and before that i was at my sister 's 4th wedding celebrations in colchester . but i need a new knee . i went for a run on sunday morning , despite the ache in my knee . got to 6.7 miles and i had to stop and walk the remaining 3 miles home as i could n't bend my right knee any more - it was agony . since then i have been icing it and taking nurofen and walking backwards downstairs . the pain has reduced , but i jogged 1.5 miles while coaching last night , and it 's not good enough to run on yet . very fed up . . off to bristol shortly .
POS another quality mileage week from tt - just looking at your target hm time compared to last year shows it 's obviously working well for you . 19 miles for me tonight , pity only 1 of them was running but good to do a bit anyway . my 9 min mile this evening was slightly more comfortable than fridays so at least i know i 'm not making it worse with my 1 mile jogs . average speed for the bike ride was 18.1 mph with a cadence average of 91.6 so a nice improvement on the same route as friday . starting to really enjoy this cycling malarky .
NEU matilda frances frith arrived at 0056 today after 29 hrs in labour , with3 1/2 pushing at the end . can only be described as brutal , i feel like i have done 10 rounds in the ring with mike tyson . however , of course she is gorgeous , but if there are ever to be anymore , it 's epidural all the way ! 3.1 kg -LRB- 6lb 13oz -RRB- so dave wins the wt , my dad won the date - was n't a fix i promise ! have n't slept really since mon morning so off to bed for me , until someone needs boobage . thanks for thinking of me , will post pics soon .
POS i go away for a week , and it takes hours to catch up . actually i 'm still away , but whiled away an hour while it was raining in sw france to log on via the wonders of a mini-laptop and campsite wi-fi . loads of congrats to the sub-35 cew at yateley -LRB- gobi , jap , tt & jock -RRB- , belated congrats to jools for her win , and to pug for racing again , plus marders , bej and others , especially wtgy who was dead unlucky to miss out on a sub-37 . nice to see crab , pug , brian and njord all making an appearance as well . training in france is going ok . it 's a brilliant area for running with miles of tarmac bike paths through the forests and along the coast road . a bit hot and hilly in places , but that 's good . also being doing some decent beach running . the beach is about 100 miles long , so you can just run as long as you like and then head back . about 60 miles for the week , including 15 miles of barefoot beach running , plus lots of sea swimming , been trying to do about 600m per day , although when there 's a current , it 's impossible to go by distance - yesterday i swam for 10 minutes and moved 10 metres - today i swam about 1000m with less effort .
POS morning all , . great running cj . i took part in a friendly experiment this morning and ran 8 miles at 8 min mile pace with an avghr of 116 . . i can honestly say i found it hard to run so slowly .
NEU i 've stopped giggling , lyndy so you just ignore this ` orrible lot !! ;--RRB-
POS i love porridge - i would eat it every day with a bit of honey -LRB- and a spoon -RRB- - although , to be truthful , i have n't actually eaten it since before london . bit dead on here today so may go a wonder and find some other poor sods to bother - the edinburgh lot are always very chatty .
POS cheers for the sock links/comments . my issues with them though is simply that they tend to stick in all the wrong places on me -LRB- same places with every pair i 've tried -RRB- . as a result i gave up wearing socks a few months back and feel better for it . the only slight niggle is the insoles on the streaks . may try glue them back and see if that does it . gobi - why braver ? for not wearing socks full stop or for not wearing them until it gets really cold ? not a bad tip there jools . i like that . 10m with a bit of pmp work thrown in at lunchtime . felt a bit rubbish at first -LRB- though hr was where it should be -RRB- , presumably from having a carp night 's sleep -LRB- jr is a little poorly at the moment so woke up a few times -RRB- , but loosened/woke up eventually . done my usual by looking for consistent splits on feel -LRB- with an occasional glance at the watch to confirm -RRB- and felt much better as it progressed . i even felt good enough to open up a bit for part of the last mile and have a bit of fun . warming up nicely here too . i was covered in goose bumps at the start , but it was quite nice by the time i finished ...
POS hmm , quiet today ! i 'm feeling better , and am just back from a bike ride . i still freak out riding a bike on the road with cars , but i 'll have to get used to it . love those trails , though ! thanks for all the support , guys ! EMO_HAPPY
POS eps , brid is not flat , but it 's not hilly either . gentle inclines , which makes it reasonably fast but more interesting . route takes you north thru bempton and out towards flamboro , then back via sewerby . nice run in thru the park and then on the front for the last mile or so . tt , nice stats

POS huge thanks susan and chi for supporting my bid for fame !
NEU how to choose ? . going on the choices for the gnr super six , it seems to me that the criteria is to have a range of ages/ability/experience , which is fair enough that way there should be something in the resulting traing programmes and blogs to help everyone on their way . to be honest if i were a judge i 'd sort the entries into non-starters -LRB- basically those who have n't followed the rules - the main one being 250 words ! -RRB- and then have an idea of the categories i was after and sort the rest into those , see if there were any stand out winners or losers , if not chuck them in a hat and draw out a winner for each catagory . while there are a few entries that pull on the heart strings , most are hard to distinguish as being any more worthwhile than another -LRB- mine being one of those -RRB- . anyway as i see it my method of choosing is probably the only way i 'll win ! ;--RRB-

NEU hi , my name is susan , nearly the dreaded 41 . my brief running history is as follows ... . dont blink or you 'll miss it ! . avoided running at school and afterwards , then i joined the fire service and learned to run with ladders and heavy pumps etc. scroll forward 10 years and i discovered that i enjoyed running -LSB- without ladders and fire kit ! -RSB- and did a 10k in about 52 minutes . scroll forward again to getting a promotion which entailed a 90 minute commute each day which effectively killed my free running time . now , working back near home and getting back into fitness . at the gym doing fitness classes a few times a week and running occasionally with my border collie pup . current goals - hubby has done 6 half marathons and i need to do a full one to beat him ! -LCB- not that he eveer mentions it - ha ! -RCB- plus i want to run off the stone + i have put on with commuting , deskjob and drinking wine ! i know i enjoy running once i get back into it . marathon goal - to get round in daylight hours and raise lots of money for the firefighters charity , the stroke association and my local hospital who looked after my dad so well . reasons for deserving this ... well , i am sure there will be more deserving than me and good luck to all of you but , on a serious note , my family has had a hard three years after my dad had a stroke and he has recently died . i have been involved with mum and dad making sure everything is ok with them and the pressure for those years has been tremendous , then my dad 's death and everything that goes with it , add onto that a very busy role at work , running a home , family , horse and small business too . . my blogs wo n't be boring but brace yourselves for tales of blood , blisters and snot !

NEU welcome carlo , sorry can not offer advice on shoes other than try another running shop and see what they recomend . ian , forgot to say , i am running the essex 20 as well , i will be running in a southend athletics vest -LRB- short woman with dark hair , spanish looking -RRB- , say hello if you see me .
NEG minni , i 'm the opposite . this morning i was perfectly happy out on the roads on my own , but once i got into the woods i started to get antsy -LRB- possibly because they back onto a fairly dodgy estate though -RRB- . i imagine murderers , rapists and savage dogs around every corner . in fact the dogs are not imagined .
POS m diddy - thats a great 20 miler , well done . went and did the 5 x 1200 session that astride challenged me to , and despite feeling a bit peaky today and yesterday , it went well . after a 2.3 m w/u @ 7:13 , the reps went 4:33 , 4:28 , 4:26 , 4:25 & 4:26 , then 2.3 home @ 7:12 . . i 've lost 6lbs since friday . that ca n't be good , can it ? mind you , i felt quite sprightly and nippy today , so maybe the old body is adapting to the constant instructions being given it ?
NEU lots of aspirations go out the window ! i have had a week off here and there in previous run-ups and been fine . if you have not done a mara before sub 4 is the big goal . took me 6 goes to get it !

NEU afternoon hairy . . trust you to smell the cake !

NEU thats good that 9mm feels easy . i remember doing a 12 mile mp run 2 weeks before my last marathon , i wouldnt have described it as easy , not hard either though , somewhere between if that makes sense . on race day i ended up averaging that pace so the fact that it felt easy is a very good sign . just run 2 miles to and from the gym to do 30 mins at the gym . legs could tell they had done something hard yesterday and hr was way higher than normal . am not going to running club tommorrow night , instead i will do some very slow miles on my own

POS fantastic captain - well done ... and to you too agt - cracking + attitude ! i looked for cg at the start but the fgfa was a bit of a free for all . i lined up with two clubmates and they were ` supposedly ' in different pens having different numbers to me ... the toilet at teh fgfa made me laugh ... the geordie comic stating that it was def not a wet race as i was lined up with 30 or 40 blokes all p & pound ; ssing up against a tarpaulin sheet ... the organisation was spot on but one query ... for those on red . did anyone else think the first two mile markers were a little out ? i was desp to keep hand brake on and sailed past mile 1 in 6.14 ?? and then at mile two i got taken by the rw 7.00 mm train steaming past on the pavement and that was at 13.30 - ok 6.45 mm for them to get settled but they really stormed past in a hurry . once red and blue mixed i pulled the reins and put less coal in the bucket . not been able to log on to vflm yet ... are there details for the gfa process ?
